She has been open about mental health, the pain of losing a mother before the Olympics trials, and her sexuality. The Dallas-native has also used the press to show her admiration for some of the legends.</p><h2>10 things about Sha’Carri Richardson</h2><p class=align-left>What was Sha’Carri childhood like? Who is she dating? Here are the ten things to know about the American sprinter.</p><h3>1. Sha’Carri Richardson has struggled with mental health</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67711b6a19526fd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenya Power Celebrates Auto Electrician Mechanic Zipporah Mulati, Who Gave Birth to All Her Kids via C-Section</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The American sprinter has been one of the professional <a href=#>athletes </a>who have been vocal about mental health. While talking to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Team US </a>during the Olympics preparations, the field sprinter opened about her struggles with mental health.</p><h3>2. She will miss the Tokyo Olympics</h3><p class=align-left>Despite having one of the best records in the past two years, Sha’Carri will miss the Olympics due to a<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> one-month ban</a> by the anti-doping agency. Even though there were talks that she could be part of the USA team for relays, her spot in the team was taken by another team member.</p><p class=align-left>Luckily, her main sponsor, Nike, has stood with her. In a statement, the company was impressed with her honesty and accountability. Through its representative, Nike has also vowed to continue supporting her, even in the future.</p><p class=align-left>So, where is Sha’Carri Richardson now? While the chances of her participating in the final races of the Olympics are now almost zero, she will not be travelling with the USA team. Interestingly, she has spent most of her time in the last month tweeting and expressing her views on sports.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8edea257553f549.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Montana Helena Klein Yao: What you should know about Malik Beasley's wife</span></p></a><h3>3. Sha’Carri Richardson's mother died a week before she qualified for the Olympics</h3><p class=align-left>Over the years, Sha’Carri biggest fan was her mother. She attended her races, both as a professional athlete and during her earlier days at the <a href=#>university</a>. Unfortunately, Sha’Carri Richardson’s mother was not around when she qualified for the summer Olympics.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67711b6a19526fd.jpg><p class=align-left>In multiple interviews, Sha’Carri has shared how her mother’s passing affected her preparations for the Olympics. Unfortunately, while training, she started taking marijuana. When the anti-doping agency discovered traces of the drug in her blood, they decided to remove her from the USA Olympics team.</p><h3>4. Sha’Carri Richardson’s parents played a huge role in her career</h3><p class=align-left>Like most A-list athletics, she started competing before her 13th birthday. From her first official race up to now, her <a href=#>family</a> has been vital in her story. In all the races she has won, Sha’Carri first goes to where her family is, then to her fans.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5fba3e432f2be68d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shanna Mendiola: 7 facts about the NBC Los Angeles weather girl</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Besides her mother, Sha’Carri has credited her grandmother for being the first people to spot her exceptional talent. Even though her grandmother will not travel to Tokyo to watch her, the world champion believes she has made her proud over the past two years.</p><h3>5. Sha’Carri chooses hair colour based on her moods</h3><p class=align-left>One of the most exciting aspects of short races is the sprinter hair colours and choice of accessories. Sha’Carri is one of the most exciting professionals to watch, thanks to her eccentric hair colour choice.</p><p class=align-left>The choice of hair is often a representation of how she feels at the particular season. Red hair, for example, is a representative of her dominating moods. When she is unsure about her makeup or hair, her girlfriend helps decide, like in the 2020 Olympics trials.</p><h3>6. She has a girlfriend</h3><p class=align-left>In an interview, Sha’Carri has confessed that she is in love. While she has not given any details about her girlfriend yet, she has described her as her support system. Her girlfriend has been <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">instrumental in her career</a>. For example, it has helped her prepare for different races, such as choosing the right hair colour for her, such as the 2020 Olympic trials.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d6d73f021751e885.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vanessa Arevalo: Quick facts about Cameron Mathison's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite being open about her sexuality, Sha’Carri Richardson’s gender has been discussed negatively, especially by some sections of the American press. Fortunately, all her regular hormone checks have indicated that she is a woman.</p><h3>7. She once ran track briefly for Louisiana State University</h3><p class=align-left>After graduating from Carter High School, Sha’Carri secured a spot at Louisiana State University. In her first year at the university, she started competing for different races. Her most iconic finish was the 2019’s NCAA titles, where she broke the record by finishing the 100 metres races in 10.75 seconds.</p><p class=align-left>Thanks to her outstanding performances at the university, she earned several honours and awards. For example, she received the 2019 Bowerman award. She was also named as the SEC freshman track athlete in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/c8edea257553f549.jpeg><p class=align-left>However, she left the LCU track and field a few months later. On her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram page</a>, she explained that the decision to leave the university’s team was to concentrate on her pro career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a7264258c37931a8.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Emily Jendrisak: The interesting life story of Gavin McInnes' wife</span></p></a><h3>8. Sha’Carri Richardson’s Nike contract amount is unknown</h3><p class=align-left>Since there is no market standard for how much an athlete should earn from a sponsorship deal, sponsors like <a href=#>Nike</a> subject professional athletes to non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). Due to Nike’s tradition of having an opaque approach to sponsorship deals, Sha’Carri contract amount is unknown.</p><p class=align-left>However, there are a few parameters to estimate her contact value. According to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Runner’s World</a>, the company offers NCAA champions a $100,000 contract. If they have multiple NCAA wins, the value may go up to $50,000. But since she won two Olympics trials, her contract value is more than $75,000.</p><p class=align-left>However, Sha’Carri Richardson’s salary is not part of her contract. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun</a> estimates her salary to be between $45,000 and $50,000.</p><h3>9. Florence Griffith Joyner is her role model</h3><p class=align-left>Since her debut on the national sports in 2019, Sha’Carri has been compared to Florence Griffith Joyner, one of the best American sprinters. While some accused her of copying somebody’s style, she confessed her admiration to the legend<a href=#> sprinter</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/091bb0c2889257a9.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Galina Becker: 10 seriously interesting facts about Roman Reign's wife</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The gold medalist also shared pictures of Joyner on her Instagram page to show respect to the talented athlete. Sha’Carri also confessed that the athlete has been instrumental to her journey by showing her that it is possible to be fashionable and competitive.</p><h3>10. She is from Dallas</h3><p class=align-left>The fast sprinter is from Dallas. Even though the city is not synonymous with producing the world’s fastest sprinters, Sha’Carri is an exception. The 21 years old athlete has broken records on national championships, and recently, she made history by becoming the sixth-fastest woman in history.</p><p class=align-left>Despite being a national treasure, Sha’Carri has not yet dropped her distinctive Dallas accent. She still uses lingos only familiar to Dallas natives, even in interviews.</p><p class=align-left>Even with the one-month suspension from sports and eventually missing on the Olympics, Sha’Carri Richardson is one of the most decorated sprinters of our time. She is not only fast but stylish, making her a darling to sports journalists and commentators.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ed8baae8aaba2c48.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the fastest woman in the world?
