Very loudly, I said, ‘That’s my dad!” Robin told the magazine. “My dad was extremely, extremely proud of that role. In a way, he kind of got to be himself as Fezzik. He was very lovable.

When I saw him, he was dad because I saw him behind the ring. I didn’t watch the matches, but I saw him backstage. So I saw him before and after but not during. … He was truly the gentle giant.”</p><p>Andre the Giant airs on A&E on Saturday, April 17, at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrulvsRmq6GdXZy2orrTZpuarZedwaa%2BjKemsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./avril-lavigne-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Avril Lavigne - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./505452-watch-international-pop-star-rihanna-dances-flavours-nwa-baby-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>WATCH: Rihanna Dances To Flavours Nwa Baby</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
