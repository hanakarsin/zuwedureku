When her pop star best friend Eden (played by <a href=#>Chaley Rose</a>) becomes the target of an obsessed fan, Heather's character, Addison, is there for her BFF no matter what. Addison and bodyguard Jackson (Pete Ploszek) team up to protect Eden, but Addison soon suspects Jackson might be in on the plot...</p><p>Ahead of the film's April 2 premiere on Lifetime, Heather Morris told Distractify that ironically, Fatal Fandom takes a page from one of cinema's best-known love stories. "The story's inspired by a <a href=#>Whitney Houston</a> film, The Bodyguard," she explained, and that was part of what got her to sign on.</p><p>"I had just done a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney Houston [remix]</a> with Clean Bandit, and I got that job and then this landed in my pocket," she said.</p><p>"I'm like, 'Whitney and Naya, are you guys working together? What's happening? You're just handing me these gems,'" Heather continued, referring to her late Glee castmate and friend Naya Rivera. "I felt like Whitney and Naya had something to do with this."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span><p>Pete Ploszek and Chaley Rose in 'Fatal Fandom'</p></figure><p>She was also excited about the opportunity to work with <a href=#>Chaley Rose</a>, who played Zoey on Nashville, as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Ploszek</a>, who voiced Leonardo in 2014's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and it's 2016 sequel.</p><p>But unlike Whitney Houston's The Bodyguard, in this movie, the bodyguard may very well be the bad guy, and it's up to Heather's character of Addison to help get her friend out of a jam. The film showcases a strong friendship where the two main characters actively support each other, and Addison is much more than Eden's sidekick. In fact, she steals certain parts of the film with her panache!</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Courtesy of Lifetime</span></figure><p>"When you're a celebrity, it's hard to find those people around you that really have your back, and I thought that my character did just that," Heather said. "She was there, along with her manager, to just be her support and be the realist, and make sure that Eden knew that there were people that really get her."</p><p>Fatal Fandom also features a music video that Heather — whose big break came as one of Beyonce's backup dancers and who also competed in Season 24 of <a href=#>Dancing with the Stars </a>— got to choreograph. Fans can see it right at the start of the movie.</p><p>"Autumn [Federici], who is our executive producer, put a little bit of something together and then [she] and I together collaborated and worked to choreograph that," Morris revealed. "That [was] exciting for me, getting to choreograph for a film."</p><p>While Heather has deservedly been front and center in several projects (fans still remember her fondly from her role as cheerleader Brittany Pierce on Glee), she pointed out that people don't always have to be the star — both in movies and in life. She explained that she enjoys being in a supportive role like the one she inhabits in Fatal Fandom, because those characters have value, too.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: Courtesy of Lifetime</span></figure><p>"I really like to play the support," she explained. "It just reflects my life right now and what I want to do for my family and my husband and my friendships and the place that I'm at right now. So [playing Addison] was coming from a place of deep truth and trying to really be present."</p><p>"Chaley was a wonderful partner to act with, because she really was present," Heather added. "It wasn't hard just to be there and be her friend and not have any agenda."</p><p>While Fatal Fandom might have Lifetime movie buffs looking at their fandom (and handsome bodyguards) differently, the movie might also leave them with a greater appreciation of best friends. They're not just there to hang out with or to like your social media posts. Sometimes they can also come to your rescue... especially if said best friend is played by Heather Morris.</p><p>Fatal Fandom premieres on Saturday, April 2 at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnbKiwMeeqWaln6e%2Fqr%2BMn5itmZxis6K6w6ikZqSZm7K1tcye</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./68944-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Muslims Are Not Responsible For The Violence In The Country - Oloyede</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gabby-daybydayvlogs-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gabby DayByDayVlogs - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
