Hint: This isn't his first time on the show.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>Any actor in New York City knows that it's a rite of passage to be on an episode (or several) of any of the <a href=#>Law & Order franchises</a>. Everyone has to start somewhere so getting cast as a guest star or recurring character in a Dick Wolf series is a pretty big accomplishment for actors.</p><p>Fans with a keen eye can often spot the actors who have returned to play multiple different characters throughout the seasons. In fact, Law & Order: SVU's newest cast member, Kevin Kane, who plays Detective Terry Bruno, has been seen as four other characters on the series, as well as two on the original Law & Order.</p><p>Who is Kevin Kane? And who is Terry Bruno? Keep reading for the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays new detective Terry Bruno on 'Law & Order: SVU'? You've surely seen actor Kevin Kane before.</h2><p>Kevin Kane is an actor, director, producer, and founding member of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Collective</a>, a theater company that creates projects which are "emotionally truthful, socially relevant, and defiantly accessible." It was founded by graduates of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the William Esper Studio</a>, an acting studio in NYC.</p><p>One of the company's other founders just happens to be <a href=#>Amy Schumer</a>! Kevin has acted in, directed, and produced several of her projects included Amy Schumer: Live at the Apollo, Inside Amy Schumer, and <a href=#>Life of Beth</a>. Kevin also was an executive producer on the latter, as well as her movie I Feel Pretty and the docuseries Expecting Amy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kevin Kane (@mugsykane)</a></p></figure><p>In addition to his work with Amy, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin</a> has also acted on <a href=#>Blue Bloods</a>, <a href=#>Chicago P.D.</a>, and <a href=#>FBI: Most Wanted</a>, just to name a few.</p><p>And as we mentioned before, Kevin is not a new name to the Law & Order family. Before his latest stint as Detective Terry Bruno, Kevin had been seen on two episodes of Law and Order (once in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 12</a> and again in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 16</a>), and four episodes of SVU (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 9</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 13</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 17</a>, and most recently in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 20</a>).</p><p>Now he makes his return in the Season 24 winter premiere, in the episode titled "Jumped In." Per the episode description, "when Benson becomes the target of a ruthless gang leader, Captain Duarte takes the case; Fin works with the Bronx SVU to help clear their case backlog; and Lieutenant Dixon offers to translate when a deaf student is raped."</p><p>While there isn't much information yet about Detective Terry Bruno, an educated guess would be that he's with the Bronx SVU unit.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><p>We'll definitely be seeing more of Detective Bruno, because Kevin is slated to appear in at least three episodes in the remainder of the current season. With <a href=#>Amanda Rollins taking a step down to be a professor</a>, there is a spot to fill. Could Detective Bruno be the one to fill it? Only time will tell.</p><p>Tune into Law and Order: SVU airing Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKedp2KxpsDEnKuirpViwaa%2B0bJkm6qlo7xuuMCwZJqmlGK8s7DEq2SsrqU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./416757-baby-laughs-hard-she-sees-herself-a-mirror-kid-looks-it-again-screams-happily-viral-video-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is That Me?
