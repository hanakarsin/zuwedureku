She had to withdraw from the Olympics after fans saw her take a noticeable stumble on the vault.</h2><p>Simone's rise to athletic superstardom has been well-documented, and virtually all of her fans were aware of her ambitions to win in gymnastics for herself and her country. Sadly, Simone's encountered a "<a href=#>medical issue</a>" that forced her to step down from the team finals.</p><p>"She will be assessed daily to determine medical clearance for future competitions," team doctors told the press.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Simone seemed to stumble and almost fall while wrapping up her vault routine.</h2><p>While concluding her routine, Simone noticeably stumbled, drawing concern from viewers.</p><p>Moments later, she huddled with a trainer and promptly exited the stadium, returning shortly after with her right leg wrapped, indicative that something had gone wrong.</p><p>Teammate <a href=#>Jordan Chiles</a> replaced Simone for the remainder of the competition, and in its final moments, Team USA fell just short of the gold medal, which ended up going to the <a href=#>ROC athletes</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Olympic pressure is ruthless.

Emotionally, that kind of varies on the time and moment. Coming here to the Olympics and being the head star isn't an easy feat, so we're just trying to take it one day at a time and we'll see."</p><p>On the potential for her to compete on July 29, 2021, in the <a href=#>all-around competition</a>, Simone said, "We're going to take it day by day, and we're just gonna see." Simone did not end up competing in the all-around competition, but did rejoin the roster for the balance beam competition, for which she won the bronze medal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr>ü§ç</p>‚Äî Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) <a href=#>July 27, 2021</a></figure><p>Beyond her television appearance, Simone took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> to reflect on her mental state and the immense weight and pressure of being not only an Olympian but the best in her sport.</p><p>"It wasn‚Äôt an easy day or my best but I got through it.
