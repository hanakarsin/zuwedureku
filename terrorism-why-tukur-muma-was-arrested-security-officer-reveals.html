And what right-thinking persons should start asking themselves, is Tukur Mamu the only Nigerian capable of handling this job?</p><p>“They should also be asking, who made him or appointed him as a negotiator, or is it because he is a media practitioner and his colleagues in the media don’t see anything bad about it? We are also looking at how did he know the terrorists and why is it that he is the only one who knows them out of the over 200 million Nigerians?</p><p>“Is he one of the terrorists, who and how do the monies paid as ransom by relatives of the hostages get to the terrorists and how much gets to the terrorists compared to what their family members have been telling the public they paid to get their relatives released?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49yZq2doqe8s7XSpmSwoKliwba31Ktkpq2dlnq4rdJmmKuqlajBprCMrJycraKewbp5zp%2BdopuVp3qzsdWemKWrXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./apex-legends-new-season-release-date.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Everything to Know About Season 14 of 'Apex Legends'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./olivia-olson-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Olivia Olson - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
