Whether it's spending time in a mental hospital like the cast of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or learning how to ice skate, which is what <a href=#>Margot Robbie</a> did for I, Tonya, they will really go the extra mile. In the new ABC show <a href=#>Queens</a>, four women that were in a hip hop group in the '90s reunite to return to their former glory.</p><p>The group, Nasty Bitches, is made up of Naomi (<a href=#>Brandy</a>), Jill (Naturi Naughton), Brianna (<a href=#>Eve</a>), and Valeria (<a href=#>Nadine Velazquez</a>). Brandy, Eve, and Naturi all have backgrounds in music and performing. Nadine, who does not, is the wild card of the bunch, which leaves us wondering if Nadine sings in Queens. Here's what we know so far about her foray into the world of hip hop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Nadine Velazquez sing in 'Queens'?</h2><p>With a name like Nasty Bitches, who wouldn't want a glorious reunion? The show itself is really going all out. Ahead of its premiere, a video for the group dropped Oct. 1 and it has all of our favorite '90s video tropes — a mansion, a yacht, and a ton of champagne. It also featured Brandy, Eve, Naturi, and Nadine rapping.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Breakfast Club</a>, the cast of Queens talked about Nadine being the new kid on the music block. Eve said, "It's funny I feel like for me, Brandy, and Naturi, it might have been slightly easy just 'cause we come from a performing background, but for Nadine, who murders it, by the way, Nadine has never performed, rap, sang like at all and she murders it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>Regarding her relationship with music, Nadine told The Breakfast Club that she was new to rap. Having been raised Pentecostal Christian, she wasn't exposed to that kind of music growing up. She went on to say that the other cast members created a safe space for her to experiment as a performer and while music is in her soul, "it's something that I haven't tapped into until now, something that would come in and out of my life, but I never felt confident enough to put myself in that position."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who was Nadine inspired by while researching the role?</h2><p>Nadine is very confident in her acting, saying that "if you can put me in a room with anybody, I'm gonna act my a-- off, and I'm gonna feel confident, but the music was, ugh what." To prepare for the role, she started listening to rappers like Cardi B. She was drawn to Cardi B. because Nadine loved how free she is with her body.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>She was also often compared to J-Lo because they are both Puerto Rican. In fact, during the filming of the pilot, Nadine was jokingly called Fake J-Lo. Because of that comparison, Nadine spent a great deal of time watching old J-Lo videos. She also discovered Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, who was in the '90s R&B group TLC.</p><p>Queens premieres Oct. 19 at 10 p.m. EST on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4ynmJ2hnpp6t7HLmrGqrZWverS1zaBkoqZdpsKmsc2s</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hakan-sukur-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hakan Sukur - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./carolina-bonistalli-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Carolina Bonistalli - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
