She played multiple seasons like an absolute boss and if you ask any longtime fans who they deem the best of the best, Janelle‚Äôs name will come up more often than not. She walked so players like Paul Abrahamian could run.</p><p>Unfortunately, with great power (and popularity) comes great responsibility (and critique). For years, Big Brother fans have speculated on whether or not Janelle has had plastic surgery, thanks to her ability to age quite gracefully and look only a tad older than she was when she started out in Season 6.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, did Janelle from 'Big Brother' have plastic surgery?</h2><p>Although Janelle has never come out to admit to plastic surgery on any part of her body, including her face, Big Brother fans have talked about the possibility for years. That‚Äôs because, if you compare some older photos of Janelle to her more current ones, her lips are noticeably fuller now and even her cheeks have a more defined definition. She also has minimal wrinkles, if any.</p><p>Looking at old photos next to newer ones of Janelle, it doesn't look like she has had any major surgeries. She has been open in the past about getting Botox injections and skin rejuvenation, and it‚Äôs the kind of minor procedures that can be done on the fly and have noticeable results. She might have also gotten lip injections, which are non-invasive as well. But as far as actual plastic surgery goes, Janelle hasn't admitted to any and it honestly doesn't seem like she has had major work done.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>#throwbackthursday Cali days! üå¥üåûI could always throw a good resting bitch face at a 10am casting call. üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è#polaroidoriginals #polaroidphoto #2002</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Janelle Pierzina</a> (@janellepierzina) on Feb 21, 2019 at 9:00am PST</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She is considered of the best female 'Big Brother' houseguests of all time.</h2><p>Instead of talking about whether or not Janelle has had plastic surgery after one of her Big Brother seasons, though, people should probably be talking about the epic games she has played over the years. Janelle is still revered as one of the top female Big Brother competitors thanks to her political and physical games.</p><p>In Big Brother 6, Janelle had two Head of Household and two Veto wins and then, in Season 7, she had four HOH and five Veto wins. Her current standing as a fierce competitor could make her an easy target for other Big Brother 22 houseguests who are threatened by her. Or, alternatively, it could help her make strong alliances from the start.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy birthday to my ride or die.

She went into the house pretending to have not spoken to fellow co-conspirator Kaysar Ridha for years. It turned out to be a ploy for both of their games, however, as she revealed on the Big Brother live feeds that she and Kaysar have remained in touch over the years.</p><p>So when he named her as his plus one for the <a href=#><u>Safety Suite prize</u></a>, it became clear that, together, Janelle and Kaysar might be able to plow through the competition and make it to the finals together. There‚Äôs still plenty of time for things to go south and for Janelle or Kaysar to be targeted for eviction, but Janelle isn't considered an all-star for nothing.</p><p>Watch Big Brother on Sundays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn66vsculnGaamZx6o77OrZ%2Beql2luaK%2F06KaZqulp7Smvtg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1392977-man-stands-lions-photos-conquering-fears-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Man 'stands' with lions in photos, says he is conquering his fears</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./february22-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>February 22 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
