a source has claimed.</p><p>Naija News earlier reported that Atiku on Saturday attended a crucial meeting of leaders and stakeholders of the PDP in Abuja which according to him was productive and had a lot of collaborative energy.</p><p>Though Atiku did not disclose further details about what transpired during the meeting, a source told Daily Trust on Sunday that the meeting was called to discuss how to make one of the ex-governors succeed Iyorchia Ayu</p><p>According to the source, loyalists of Atiku within the party were the ones who attended the meeting and that is why the PDP National

government to work.</p><h2>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
