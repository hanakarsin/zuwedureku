So the idea of grave/tomb robbing isn't something I'm into, because I don't want a visit from any supernatural creatures chasing me to the ends of the earth.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>But ancient artifacts is where I draw the line. If I find an old-timey safe or something that's existed in the last couple of centuries and it's filled with modern day cash and goods, you best believe I'm going to take that stuff with a clear conscience or fear of repercussion.</p><p>Which is why I can't understand, for the life of me, why this couple would do what they did when they discovered a rusty safe behind some trees in their backyard. A safe that they thought for the longest time was just an electrical box. It wasn't.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This couple thought a piece of rusty metal behind some trees in their backyard was just part of a cable or electrical box, but it turned out to be a safe containing $52,000 in cash, gold and diamonds <a href=#>https://t.co/ig0vexJkp1</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pkmpnjZYcy</a></p>â€” CNN (@CNN) <a href=#>May 18, 2018</a></figure><p>This gross-looking box was on their property. This gross looking box contained $52,000 in cash, gold, and diamonds. This gross looking box could been their next decadent vacation. A double-or-nothing "bet on black" single game of roulette.
