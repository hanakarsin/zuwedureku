It’s only natural, then, for people who both like and dislike Ben to wonder who his wife and family are.</p><p>Ben is one of the best-known influencers on the right, and although he frequently gets made fun of for his political takes and commentary by those on the left, it seems he has been happily married for quite some time. Here’s what we know about Ben’s wife and family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Ben Shapiro’s wife?</h2><p>Ben’s wife is Mor Shapiro, previously Mor Toledano. Mor is of Moroccan descent and was born and raised Herzliya, a city located near Tel Aviv in Israel, in 1988. Her parents moved to the U.S. when she was 12 and she obtained U.S. citizenship.</p><p>Mor is a family medicine doctor and she previously worked at the Family Medicine Residency Program at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Fontana, Calif.</p><p>Perhaps somewhat ironically, Mor focuses on women’s health and advocates for awareness around diseases that affect women, specifically. Her advocacy doesn’t explicitly conflict with her husband’s worldview and philosophies, but for many, issues like abortion, which Ben strongly opposes, are also a question of women’s health. Regardless, it seems that Mor and Ben have been able to reconcile whatever beliefs they might not share.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who are Ben Shapiro’s kids?</h2><p>Ben has tried to keep many of the details about his family life private, but he has been open about how much love and support he gets from his loved ones. Ben and Mor have four children together, and although Ben celebrates his children’s births on social media, he doesn’t share much else from his family. All of his children are still young, and all of them still live at home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Nailed it. My wife is currently pregnant with our fourth child. <a href=#>https://t.co/20UOoKrrXk</a></p>— Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) <a href=#>February 16, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What is Ben Shapiro’s ethnicity?</h2><p>Ben was born in Los Angeles to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. His family converted to Orthodox Judaism when he was nine years old, and he still practices Judaism to this day. As may be expected given who his wife is and his own political views, Ben has been an outspoken supporter of Israel throughout the ongoing war in Gaza following the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.</p><p>Few commentators of any political valence have faced more backlash than Ben, and that backlash has helped make him one of the best-known right-wing commentators in the world. Although Ben says outrageous things in part to earn the ire of his political opponents, there are also aspects of Ben’s identity that are less directly related to their political views.</p><p>Given how firmly held Ben's political stances are, and how uninterested he often seems in actually changing his views, it seems unlikely that Ben is actually going to win over new supporters. The people who love him will continue to do so, and those who find him outrageous will continue to be outraged by him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KvedKhmKmhoqR6uLXFng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1405324-corper-renovates-broken-classroom-kogi-fixes-roof-paints-walls-service-year-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Corps member renovates broken classrooms in Kogi; fixes roofs, paints walls during service year</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./we-tried-taco-bell-cinnamon-twists-cereal.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taco Bell Cinnamon Twists Cereal</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
