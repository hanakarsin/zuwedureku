On the <a href=#>TLC</a> show, we have come to know the <a href=#>lovestruck Americans</a> willing to cross oceans (and continents!) to meet their overseas crushes for the very first time. Before they can say "I do," they've got to navigate challenges and cultural barriers. Let's just say, it's not all rose petals and rainbows.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This is exactly the trajectory that Sheila Mangubat and David Dangerfield's love story has taken. Following along with the couple's intercultural relationship has been refreshing and eye-opening, guiding us through themes of cultural shock, as well as a barrage of feels toward the couple, who have had to overcome multiple barriers on their journey.

When David finally saw the reality of Sheila's living situation with her parents and son, he couldn't hold back the welling tears.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a preview of the show, we notice that Sheila breaks down in tears as someone is being put into the casket, and as Sheila is sobbing, David — who is visiting her in the Philippines — makes an attempt to comfort her. Although there was much speculation ahead of the big reveal in the July 30 episode, fans weren't quite sure what happened.</p><p>Sadly, it turns out, Sheila lost her mother just a day after David made the trip to meet her parents.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Sheila's home concerns David on '90 Day Fiancé: Before the 90 Days.'</h2><p>When David meets Sheila's family, including her now late mother, he notes how the home is in such extreme disrepair, from fragile stairs that look more like a ladder to a lack of running water. Sheila worries that it could make David rethink their relationship, but he just feels concern for her and her family's health and safety and he spends the night.</p><p>It's when they wake up the next morning that they find Sheila's mom unresponsive at the bottom of the dangerous stairs in the home. No one had heard her fall down the stairs in the early morning hours.</p><p>"It happened unexpectedly," Sheila tells producers in the July 30 episode. "David and my mom just met.
