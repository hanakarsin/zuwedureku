The birth of Jee-Yun Han ushers in a new era for the first responders, who have had their share of tragedy in the past.</p><p>But with the birth of Jee-Yun comes some more sadness for the couple. Throughout the end of Season 4, fans watched Maddie struggle with postpartum depression. And while she seemed to be better in the Season 5 premiere, showrunner Tim Minear promised that the worst isn't over yet — a promise that was fulfilled in Episode 3. Did Maddie just leave 9-1-1?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is Maddie leaving ‘9-1-1’?</h2><p>On May 18, Jennifer Love Hewitt and her husband, Brian Hallisay, announced that they would be welcoming their third child together.</p><p>Jennifer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, “We had always been open to a third, but definitely didn't think in the crazy year that the entire world was having that it would necessarily be this moment."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jennifer Love Hewitt (@jenniferlovehewitt)</a></p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @jenniferlovehewitt</a></figure><p>"I feel like we've been able to so far raise two really special kids who will be great role models. This has been such a pleasant, beautiful, surprising gift in this time to be able to get to do all that again with another little human,” she added. On Sept. 9, Jennifer gave birth to Aidan James, so it's likely she was pregnant at some point while filming Season 5 of 9-1-1.</p><p>Unlike Jennifer, however, Maddie is having a much harder time coping with new motherhood. In Season 4 of 9-1-1, viewers learned that the dispatcher was struggling with postpartum depression, which, according to Jennifer, is a very real issue for working moms.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Jennifer told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a>, “We always play things pretty real on this show. You will see the good in the heart about both of those things. I’m really happy to get to play that for working moms out there who are watching.”</p><p>After giving birth, fans saw Maddie decide to leave her job for her mental health, but even worse, Episode 3 of Season 5 saw Maddie decide that she's not safe for her daughter to be around.</p><p>Maddie dropped her child off at the firehouse, along with a video message for Chimney: "I’m sure that you are confused, hurt, and probably really scared. I don’t know what to say. You don’t need to go to the police or come looking for me. I’m not in any danger and no one is making me do this. Jee-Yun is not safe with me, not now and maybe [not ever]. I know that you’re going to take really good care of her, and she’s better off without me. I love you. I love both of you. And I’m really sorry.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>chim's face while he was watching maddie's video :(( <a href=#>#911onFOX</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zyhB90zTyn</a></p>— mar • 911 spoilers !

He told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TV Line</a>, “It’s a story that I don’t want to give short shrift to. It will end up creating a major complication for Season 5.”</p><p>After we saw Maddie going to therapy and taking medication to work on herself at the season's start, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tim revealed even more</a>. "She is isolated. She is going through something very serious, and it’s going to take a very serious turn by the next episode," referencing what we now know to be the point at which Maddie abandons her daughter. According to Tim, Maddie's story will play out and cause more struggles in the beginning and middle of the season.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>"It’s going to take a big turn in the next two episodes," Tim warned. "These first responders are put on call 24 hours in a big crisis like this. So he’s very worried about her, but they’re separated, and so there are going to be some repercussions to that separation." What could that mean for Chimney and Maddie? And for their family?</p><p>Their fate might be in danger, but as far as we know, Maddie's place on 9-1-1 is still safe. Considering the timing of the birth of Jennifer's new baby, it seems likely that Maddie running away offered Jennifer some time away from the cameras to give birth and bond with her new baby boy. We should expect that she'll have some limited screentime moving forward, but Jennifer has not announced any intention to leave the show.</p><p>Watch new episodes of 9-1-1 every Monday at 8 p.m. EST on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucCdm6KdXaGyosLIp55mcV1menI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-eskem-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Molly Eskam - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1184776-access-bank-payday-loan-terms-conditions-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Access Bank payday loan: terms and conditions to know (2022)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
