David Umahi, has disclosed that those serving at the highest echelon of his government aligned with his mindset, pointing out that this has led to the success of his administration.</h2><p><a href=#><strong>Naija News</strong></a> reports that he stated this on Wednesday when he received a former Governor of Borno State, <strong>Ali Modu Sheriff</strong>, who was in the state to make consultations on contesting for the national chairmanship position of the All Progressives Congress (APC).</p><p>Umahi, who said he will support Sheriff if the contest is thrown open, was quick to add that President Muhammadu Buhari has a significant role to play in who becomes the national chairman of the APC.</p><p>He then went on to say, “When one person has a good heart and the rest of us do not and are not patriotic, no development can take place.</p><p>“You can see that my executive council members melted their hearts into mine, which made us have good hearts and achieve a lot.</p><p>“I thank you (Sheriff) for informing us of your decision to contest the APC national chairmanship, but the president, who is the leader of the party, has a role to play.</p><p>“He is the only one that can take the decision, but if it is thrown open, you are my choice. The president can say in the interest of the party, let another person be there; we will obey him.”</p><p>In his remarks, Sheriff said he was in Ebonyi State to consult with the Governor due to his influence in the South-east.</p><p>The former Borno governor commended Umahi for his governance efforts, adding that the APC is proud of his achievements in the state.</p><p>“You are very influential in APC and your fellow governors and leaders across the country rate you highly for your infrastructural strides, among other achievements,” he said.</p><p>Sheriff however maintained that the next Nigerian president can come from any part of the country, adding that Buhari should be supported to complete his tenure.</p><p>“It is, however, not the time to talk about the next president because an incumbent is still in office and should be supported to accomplish his goals,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5BvZp6an6PGqnnCqKSmoaOotrC6xKuqZqWVocGmsIytn56homK1pq3RrapmoZ6pvG65yKecZp%2Bfq3q2ucChoGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./horia-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Horia - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./deidre-hall-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deidre Hall - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
