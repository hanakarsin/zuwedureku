This was linked to heavy cigarette smoking, so he quit and made a full recovery.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Bob Newhart broke ground with his stand-up comedy and television shows.</h2><p>George Robert "Bob" Newhart was born Sept. 5, 1929, in Oak Park, Ill. Before pursuing a career in comedy, he got a degree in business and was drafted into the United States Army, serving from 1952 to 1954. He then returned to Chicago and began working as a copywriter for a film company, and found his true calling for comedy.</p><p>Newhart released his debut comedy album "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart</a>" in 1960, which received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year and led him to be the only stand-up comedian to win the Grammy for Best New Artist. It was this album that brought him from nightclub shows to comedy stardom.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Newhart later went on to create The Bob Newhart Show, one of the most classic sitcoms of all time. The Bob Newhart Show ran from 1972 to 1978, for 142 episodes.</p><p>In 1982, he starred in another sitcom, Newhart, which lasted for eight seasons and arguably has one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best sitcom endings of all time</a>.</p><p>Bob is survived by his children, Robert Jr., Timothy, Courtney, and Jennifer, and 10 grandchildren, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.
