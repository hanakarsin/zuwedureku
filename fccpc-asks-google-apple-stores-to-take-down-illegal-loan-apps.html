All the bank accounts that were provided were immediately blocked but these companies operate multiple bank accounts with multiple names.</p><p>“Between the time we raided and now, we have discovered additional 30 accounts and all have been frozen and we will continue to freeze as we discover them.”</p><p>“I am certain that with the actions that we have taken and the nature of the engagement we are having with the loan companies, at least three of the major ones that their businesses have been severely affected by either our search or the account closure they are modifying”, Irukera noted.</p><p>The FCCPC chairman said though the processes will take some time, he can assure that the space will change soon.</p><p>Irukera called for an improved partnership with the media to educate members of the public on their consumer rights in order to achieve the objectives of the commission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5JpZp%2Bbk6Wwbq3SpKpmn5%2BktK2xjJqnqaSVYsC1u9Geqmasn2LBorfEZpuor55itq24xKCYpWWcpK6vecCpp6xn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jane-goodall-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jane Goodall - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kelly-ellard-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Is Kelly Ellard Now?
