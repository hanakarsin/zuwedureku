"It's hard to be away from your partner that you love so much, but it also helps when that partner is very, very understanding and you keep that line of communication together. It was very important."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Rachel and Vincenzo break up?</h2><p>Rachel explained that while Vincenzo didn't work in yachting the way she does, he was "very, very understanding about the time away" and supportive of her career, more generally. One thing he wasn't so supportive of, however, might have been the fact that she participated in a reality TV series. "He wasn't a very big fan of me going to film," she says.</p><p>"It took us five months to get back together — well, to see each other again from the start of filming," she went on. After Season 8 wrapped its production, it sounds like Rachel was stranded at sea for 21 days until she was ultimately able "to get back to him."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Rachel Hargrove (@chefrachelhargrove)</a></p></figure><p>"Before I knew it, it was done," she says with a sigh, though she's ultimately grateful it happened now, "before we're married and have children."</p><p>Through her characteristically upbeat and hilarious Instagram page, Rachel has let fans into what her life looks like these days when she's not yachting, and it looks like the "clean start" she wanted after the breakup.</p><p>"It's actually been a wonderful life, so nothing's been bad," she revealed on the Below Deck After Show. "I've got a beautiful little apartment I love. I'm here in a good area where I can work on boats. I'm signed on to a boat, so everything works out perfect."</p><p>How has she coped with the breakup? "You've got to keep a positive attitude," she says. "I deal with everything with sarcasm, so I'm good to go."</p><p>For those who don't already follow this extremely talented chef on social media, we urge you to stay current with Rachel's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram updates</a>. Through her IGTV channel, the ayurvedic practitioner and all-around star chef has been giving recipe tutorials, tours of Italian markets, and even inviting followers in with her as she dines, cooks, and shops for some of the most delicious meals in Europe.</p><p>The Season 8 reunion airs Feb. 22 at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvsCcn56kXZu%2FsLmMm5ylp6disaavymaqraGcoXq4tdOhZKGdomKvsMXFq6CeppQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./christians.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Christians On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-shabalin-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Maria Shabalin - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
