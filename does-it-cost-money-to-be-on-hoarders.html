On many of the episodes, we see people attempting to sell different items and help with moving costs, but does it actually cost money to be on the show? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does it cost money to be on ‘Hoarders?'</h2><p>A&E does not charge anyone to be on Hoarders and the show actually pays for all the services involved with helping people while they are on the show. In an interview with Xfinity, via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, Jodi Fynn, a producer on the show, said that Hoarders pays for a lot of what we see on screen. It pays for the cleaning services, therapists, and other experts who appear on the show.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"These are enormously expensive cleanouts," Jodi said. "If people were to call 1-800-GOT-JUNK or Matt Paxton’s company, Clutter Cleaner, these cleanouts can cost tens of thousands of dollars. There are no costs to the people who appear on our show."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>No cost to the subjects or their families may be a large part of the reason why people choose to get help on Hoarders. According to Jodi, tons of people want to be on the show, and the production crew does its best to find people who have extreme cases and need more help than they may have available to them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do hoarders ever recover?</h2><p>Hoarders can recover and there have been cases on Hoarders: Where Are They Now? where fans see people who are able to keep their homes clean a year after the cleanup. But it often depends on how the hoarding is dealt with. On Hoarders, we know that there is aftercare provided that participants can choose to take. But all the experts on the show advise against just throwing things away without dealing with the emotional or psychological issues behind hoarding.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christiana Bratiotis</a>, the former director of the Hoarding Research Project at the Boston University School of Social Work, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> that she did a study with the Elder Services of Merrimack Valley in Massachusetts where they typically did a full cleanup of someone's property, but it never worked because they didn't address the emotional and psychological issues behind the person's hoarding.</p><p>Eventually, people would fill their homes right back up. And on top of that, they became angry and didn't trust others to help them with the problem in the future. But thanks to the methods seen on Hoarders, like letting the person with the issue be in charge of decision-making, many were able to ultimately avoid eviction.</p><p>You can watch Hoarders on A&E, Discovery Plus, and Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbymv4yiq2abn6jBbrnOp5yyZaSkeqOxjKilZqCflr%2BlsdGs</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./413836-newspaper-review-for-may-31-uhuru-lands-in-kisumu-with-goodies-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Newspapers Review For May 31: Uhuru Lands In Kisumu With Goodies</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./56364-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chief Buruji Kashamu Replies Ex-President: Obasanjo No Longer Relevant in S/West, Says He is Liar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
