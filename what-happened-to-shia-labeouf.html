Following the success of the show, Shia went on to appear in Holes, Transformers, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In addition to his budding career, Shia found himself in a string of controversies. Shia’s first brush with the law came in 2007 after the Tax Collector star was arrested for refusing to leave a Chicago area Walgreens at 2:25 a.m., per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TODAY</a>. Seven years later, Shia was arrested for disrupting a performance of Cabaret.

While detained, the actor went on a racist tirade which was captured on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>. In October 2020, Shia was charged with misdemeanor battery and petty theft after taking a man’s hat following a physical altercation. A few months later, singer <a href=#>FKA Twigs</a> filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a> against Shia, claiming that he abused her during their relationship.</p><p>Shia and FKA Twigs have agreed to postpone the trial. The mutual decision pushed the date from Nov. 6, 2023, to Oct. 14, 2024. According to a court filing, "the parties have diligently conducted discovery, but certain discovery issues remain to be resolved.”</p><p>Basically, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a> reported, there are still disputes over some of the evidence and documents that need to be settled.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Following the slew of scandals, Shia has returned to the spotlight and shows no signs of slowing down.

He appears as the titular character in Padre Pio, which debuted in the U.S. on June 2, 2023. The film chronicles the journey of an Italian priest, Padre Pio, who later becomes one of Catholicism’s most beloved saints. While filming the movie, Shia lived in a monastery of Franciscan Capuchin friars and the experience led him to join the Roman Catholic Church.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“When I got here, a switch happened … it was like someone tricked me into it,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he explained</a> during a sit-down with Bishop Robert Barron. Shia added that he was battling suicidal thoughts and depression during that time but found peace thanks to Padre Pio's teachings. He said, “It was seeing other people who have sinned beyond anything I could ever conceptualize also being found in Christ that made me feel like, ‘Oh, that gives me hope.’”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Shia also explained that he was in the early stages of his conversion to Catholicism but was excited to dive deeper into his religious quest.
