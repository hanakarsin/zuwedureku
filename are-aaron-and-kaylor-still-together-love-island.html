Now, we get to see how the relationships from the villa will hold up in the real world. Fans are particularly curious about if Aaron and <a href=#>Kaylor</a> are still together.</p><p>Aaron and Kaylor captivated the world's attention when they coupled up immediately, staying as an item relatively consistently throughout the show. Despite their commitment to each other, they did have a few speed bumps. The question is: Did they have any more once they left the bubble of Love Island?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Peacock</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Aaron and Kaylor from 'Love Island' still together?</h2><p>At the Season 6 reunion, Aaron and Kaylor drop a bombshell: They’ve are no longer together. Aaron confesses to host Ariana Madix that things have been rocky since leaving the villa, admitting he's solely to blame for the breakup because he flat-out lied to Kaylor.</p><p>Aaron gets into the nitty-gritty details of his tangled relationship with Daniela Ortiz-Rivera, but Kaylor quickly loses her cool. She yells at him for keeping the truth from her for so long, demanding that he own up to his mistakes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kaylor finally clocking Aaron, she better not run back to him either <a href=#>#loveislandusa</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vVnFFDzsz0</a></p>— Julia Chenbot (@bigbrotherss3) <a href=#>August 20, 2024</a></figure><p>"Why do you keep f–king lying to me? And quit love-bombing me!" Kaylor yells, making it clear she’s done with Aaron. She tells him she never wants to see or speak to him again, expressing her frustration over wasting her summer on him. Kaylor calls him out as disgusting and a "piece of s--t," before swapping seats with Liv.</p><p>Rob steps in to defend Aaron, acknowledging that while Aaron has made mistakes and struggles, he's not a terrible person. Ariana seems to agree, nodding along as Rob speaks.</p><p>When Ariana presses for details on their fallout, especially since Aaron and Kaylor appeared so tight on social media after filming, Kaylor explains that watching the show, especially the "Casa Amor" drama, was a turning point.</p><p>But despite witnessing Aaron's betrayal, she continued to reach out to him during tough times, even though Aaron claims otherwise. He mentions that his grandfather's passing, which coincided with Kaylor's appearance on the BFFs podcast where she supposedly trashed him, made things even more complicated.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kaylor gagging aaron…show him the Alabama Barbie doesn’t play <a href=#>#loveislandusa</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/vdLHyg9sdS</a></p>— Nicolas is happy (@niggaolas) <a href=#>August 20, 2024</a></figure><p>Kaylor recalls offering condolences and checking in on Aaron, but when she presses him on why he didn't come clean about his past with Daniela, especially while staying in her Fiji hotel room, Aaron admits he could never find the right moment. He explains that he didn't want to ruin their reunion in New York, so he chose to reveal everything at the reunion, which turned out to be a disastrous decision.</p><p>In the end, Aaron apologizes deeply for all the pain he caused Kaylor.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kaylor previously said it was hard for her to trust Aaron.</h2><p>Following the Season 6 finale, Kaylor hopped on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viall Files</a> podcast and admitted it was hard for her to trust Aaron. She noted that she was "really scared of getting hurt, but I am really young and I need to experience this."</p><p>"It would be very easy for me to be like, 'OK, Aaron, we’re done. I don't want to talk to you.' But I just know that there is something there," Kaylor said about giving the relationship a genuine go. "If it blows up in my face, it does, and I'll learn from it."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>kaylor said she wasn’t crying at the reunion and i didn’t believe her. you proved me wrong queen <a href=#>#loveislandusa</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/0yH8FMZ91K</a></p>— sammy ™ (@strghtbcktosam) <a href=#>August 20, 2024</a></figure><p>As for Aaron's take, he was initially a little less open to the public about what was going on in his mind. However, he did hint at some behind-the-scenes drama on the island.</p><p>In fact, he blamed the producers for putting extra pressure on their relationship, almost fishing for drama. "Love Island USA, the stronger you are as a couple, the more they challenge you," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">StyleCaster</a>.</p><p>Aaron added. "I can’t say that much about it because we’re not allowed. But they will challenge you so hard, so that is definitely an aspect that I didn't think about going into it, but I met Kaylor and that’s the bit. So I'm happy."</p><p>Love Island USA is now streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2BmecCaqaimXZa7pXnKmrClp6JiwLW1y6VkraeXmsGpsdFmo6iulWK2tLjAp5s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-play-as-batman-gotham-knights.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Batman Is Dead in 'Gotham Knights' Or Is He?
