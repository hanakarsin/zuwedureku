He also said that the life of the then APC presidential candidate might be cut short, and that Buhari might not finish his tenure of four years.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Pastor Enoch Adeboye Reveals 2015 Prophecies</a></p><p>The prophet in a new interview with Encomium has revealed new things about Nigeria. While talking to Encomium from Chicago, Illinois, United States of America (where he’s on a revival and evangelical mission), the man of God reversed his prophesy on Buhari dying in office. Though he warned him not to waste any time to change Nigeria, Prophet Tibetan said God has given General Buhari a new lease of life like biblical King Hezekiah. Prophet Tibetan also spoke extensively about the senate president, David Mark, and declared that Governor Ayo Fayose will not see the end of 2015 as the Ekiti state governor. Read excepts from the engaging interview below:</p><p><strong>Nigerians and the world at large are surprised that all your prophesies concerning the country and the 2015 general elections have come to pass. How does it feel, sir?</strong></p><p>It’s not for me to take the glory of fulfillment of God’s word (quotes relevant scriptures to support his position). So, no genuine prophet should take the credit of this. God will always honour His word. At the same time, we give God the glory.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Buhari May Be Stoned In 6 Months’ Time – Popular Pastor</a></p><p><strong>So, Buhari would change Nigeria?</strong></p><p>Yes, the Lord said there’s going to be change.&nbsp; He said we should congratulate Nigerians for taking the strong decision to liberate themselves from bad leadership. The Lord said Nigerians should welcome the spirit of change as it is taking place not just only in the political arena but across all families and up to the kitchens in various homes. God said He is the One that brought this change and all Nigerians must embrace it and be in the spirit of WAI (War Against Indiscipline).</p><p><strong>But in your interview with us before the Presidential elections, you said he might not complete his tenure?&nbsp; Has that changed?</strong></p><p>Buhari will not die in office. God prolonged the life of King Hezekiah in the Bible and this is Buhari’s portion. He won’t die in office. He has a job to do.&nbsp; There is no time to waste. Mr. President-elect should hit the ground running on his first day in office because he already has the template of what he wants to do to liberate Nigeria since 2003. Remember I told the world in my Prediction 2015 book that General Buhari is not chosen by God but by the people of Nigeria to liberate them and since he is the one the people want, God answered their prayer by giving him the leadership of the country.&nbsp; Buhari should run the affairs of Nigeria without fear or favor because he has a limited time to do this work. The Bible made it clear that due to sin and other unforeseen element of our daily life, the number of years given to man in Biblical term is 70 years. He is over 70.&nbsp; Anything beyond that is grace; General Buhari should take note of this and change the fortune of this country without fear or favor. This new regime will be the one to give us a credible census. Before two years, the government must carry out a census to ascertain how many people were killed by Boko Haram and how many Nigerians are living presently. This is good for national planning.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>:&nbsp;Divine Message! Guru Maharaji Reveals Who’ll Win Presidential Election</p><p><strong>Many are worried that the crop of leaders we have now can’t save us?</strong></p><p>The new leadership must be ready to follow their CHANGE mantra to the letter.&nbsp; It is not about declaring assets alone.&nbsp; Each ministerial appointee should be given a portion in either the Holy Quran or the Holy Bible to make a specific oath of allegiance to service upon him or herself that if&nbsp; ‘I will be taking Nigeria back to the corruption era in any way, let this and this and that happen to me and my family.’&nbsp; For the Christian Ministers, the book of Joshua Chapter 6 verse 26 should be used where Joshua charged the Israelites and it read thus: “Cursed be the man before the Lord who rises up and builds this city Jericho; he shall lay the foundation with his first born, and with his youngest he shall set up its gates.’</p><p>So, for any incoming minister who will take Nigeria back to the era of massive corruption and looting, let that person lay the foundation of his corrupt act with his first born and round off his service in government with his last child. This is also to be applied to Muslim ministers with a corresponding portion used in the Holy Quran. The traditional worshippers should also be made to take an oath with an item of their religious belief.</p><p>General Buhari should not take any ministerial nominee based on political party affiliation. Don’t take names from Obasanjo or anybody and if at all you must take, such a person should go through the normal, standard screening process and if he passes the test, good for him and if not he should be dumped. General Buhari should look at the crop of very intelligent Nigerians in various countries of the world like Britain, Canada, America, Australia, France and many other places. Some of the finest brains in those countries are Nigerians. Some of the finest professors of sciences and social culture are equally Nigerians; these are the kind of people General Buhari need to run this in-coming regime. He should make it 60-40 affair; 60 percent Diaspora based Nigerians and 40 percent local heads and those 40 percent should be the very best of our brains as there is no room for setback in this government. Buhari alone cannot enforce the change but his team of experts will do a great job that will enforce the desired change in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>But don’t you think Nigerians have a lot to do in this era of change?</strong></p><p>First, every Christian in Nigeria should help General Buhari and Professor Osinbajo with special prayers with Psalm 91 and Psalm 37 every day. This will go a long way in making every aspect of governance run and the driver, General Buhari will be able to run the affairs of this great country very well. The Muslims should also find ways to assist the government with prayers; so should other faiths in the country. Secondly, Nigerians must be told that yam and tomatoes will never germinate from the screens of our Laptop or tablets. So, everybody must be prepared to go back to the farm. Farm is where the greatest economic liberation lies. We must learn to use our hoes and cutlasses in terms of small- scale farming. And let every government at each level bring on the tractors and let’s utilize all our fallow lands. The Lord said we should salute the northerners for keeping the nation strong and alive with their food produce in the last four decades but right now.&nbsp; Every part of the country must join the north to produce food because we cannot raise food produce on the surface of our laptop or computer. We have to embrace mechanised farming.</p><p><strong>What again should be done?</strong></p><p>Nigeria should not exist again.</p><p><strong>How do you mean, Prophet?</strong></p><p>But I’ve always said, we should be called the United States of Nigeria.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on corruption?</strong></p><p>Corruption must be arrested totally. Nigerians should not take the issue of corruption with kid gloves as the era of wanton corruption is gone and our country is about to witness a massive change that will touch every aspect of our lives.&nbsp; The spirit of Buhari/Idiagbon should return. For instance, if you suspect anyone in your neighborhood who is opulent and living above his means of earning or just became rich overnight, you should report him to anti-corruption agencies and let them investigate him. Former leaders who stole government money should return all the money stolen. The new Buhari/Osinbajo regime must not borrow any money with the kind of money in stolen hands. The amount of money in private loots and other places is enough for a government to kick start an economic initiative that will change the face of the country for life.&nbsp; The money seized from Abacha, Tafa Balogun, Cecilia Ibru, Stella Oduah and Alison Madueke is enough to run a credible economic system. There are more people who should be encouraged to return their loots and we will see a greater Nigeria.</p><p><strong>Should Buhari probe government officials?</strong></p><p>Yes, Buhari should probe anyone that has looted the commonwealth of the country since 1999.</p><p><strong>You’ve always been critical of owners of private universities in Nigeria. Why, sir?</strong></p><p>Government must find out where and how they got money to establish such institutions and why do they take such exorbitant amount of money to give education. Government must look into the education sector and run that sector itself; all these private institutions should be monitored by government and those ran by pastors and religious organizations should be taken back and run by the government as that is not what the lord asked these men of God to do. I have said it once, that all Nigerian General Overseers need deliverance and today we can all see my point because they are corrupt. They got free education from the missionaries but today, they won’t allow people in this generation and next generation have access to free education.&nbsp; They used free offering from worshipers to build highly monetized institutions that even their church members cannot attend. This must stop, it must totally stop. The incoming government must uphold justice and fairness.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> <a href=#>Ghanaian Pastor Predicts What Will Happen To President Jonathan During Election</a></p><p><strong>You’ve been hammering on the President of the Senate, David Mark. What’s the matter with the fifth term senator?</strong></p><p>In my 2015 Prediction book, I advised David Mark to retire from politics and let younger ones come on board.&nbsp; As an elder statesman and president of the Senate, you allowed President Jonathan to waste tax payer’s money on National Conference with no result. The treasury is looted without qualms as the government packs physical cash to South Africa in private jets. To the members of the 8th Senate, David Mark must be avoided like a plague. He must never be given any portfolio, let him just be an ordinary floor member. &nbsp;This is the position of the Lord on him because he joined in ruining this country and the Lord said he might be jailed like Obasanjo.</p><p><strong>Sir, you told us that no force would stop the Lion of Bourdillion, Asiwaju in Lagos now Ambode is Governor. He also delivered the three APC senators, in addition to electing APC’s Buhari president?</strong></p><p>Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Governor Rotimi Amaechi of Rivers State, Governor Rochas Okorocha of Imo state and former President Olusegun Obasanjo are heroes who saved Nigeria and Nigerians from death. They are the Gideons of our time and their role in liberating Nigeria from problem is noted before God. God is happy with Tinubu, Obasanjo, Rochas Okorocha, Amaechi and Murtala Nyako, the former Governor of Adamawa state. Nigerians should give kudos to them for their heroic act.&nbsp; Anyone who equally joined in liberating this country is a Gideonite.&nbsp; However, the Lord said they should leave Buhari and Osinbajo to do the work as what God wants to use them to achieve in Nigeria is beyond any human gesture. There should not be any interference from any quarters.</p><p><strong>What are the major tasks before Buhari/Osinbajo?</strong></p><p>It’s power and judicial reform.&nbsp; They are key.&nbsp; The Lord said every importer of generator in this country will be out of business by 2020 as the Lord is set to arrest all the challenges in the Nigeria’s power sector. General Buhari and Professor Osinbajo should carry out strong and merciless reforms in the power sector and the judiciary. If these two key areas are taken care of,Nigeria will truly be free. If the judiciary works, justice will bring equality to everyone and if the power sector works, there will be development in all areas of the socio-economic life of the country. The new government must investigate all economic malpractices in the power sector right from the 1999 to date and anyone found guilty should be prosecuted. All sectors, all industries should also be revamped and status quo changed.</p><p><strong>Let’s return to the general election.&nbsp; You predicted there would be no violence, but there were plenty of that especially in Rivers and some other states?</strong></p><p>The Lord said he didn’t want bloodshed for 2015 elections yet the people of Rivers state killed for the election. The Lord said he is bringing a terrible event on Rivers state and the people must start asking for forgiveness for the souls they wasted in that election. God said He is going to punish Rivers state for going against His will and there will be calamity in the state except they seek God’s face and do the needful.</p><p><strong>Nigerian lawmakers have been taking so much money, what’s the panacea to this?</strong></p><p>The Lord said this reform is His design and the change is total. Legislators should not earn more than what lecturers are earning in higher institutions because the lecturers are more productive than the legislators as they teach and build new Nigerians every year. So, a legislator should not earn more than a lecturer or head master of a secondary school. This is what the Lord wants and that is what the Buhari/Osinbajo government should implement. Majority of these legislators collecting millions upon millions can’t even boast of a single law they have enacted to the glory of fatherland.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Oyedepo Prophesies What Will Happen Before And After Forthcoming Elections</p><p><strong>Is there anything Buhari should do before moving into the Aso Rock presidential villa?</strong></p><p>Yes, if General Buhari want to run his term successfully and does not want the fate of late President Umar Yar’Adua to befall him, he must make a complete and total cleansing of Aso Rock Villa before he moves in. Between now and when he would be sworn in, General Buhari must not step into Aso Rock Villa for any meeting either in the day or in the night. And after he is sworn in on May 29, he must ensure that America, Britain and Germany help him snoop around the entire Aso Rock vicinity to detect anything that might have been planted in there for him. An entirely new security measure should be put in place to ensure the total security and safety of the new landlord. Until then, the General could run his own “White House” from anywhere but Aso Rock.</p><p><strong>Will Ekiti State Governor still be impeached?</strong></p><p>The Lord does not do mistake with his words, Ayo Fayose has just nine months to stay on that seat after which he will be going to jail. I don’t really have much to say on this.&nbsp; I have told you what the Lord will do on December 20 when I was launching my prediction book in Nigeria. Ayo Fayose will not see the end of 2015 as Ekiti State Governor.</p><p>Not long ago, the general overseer of the Messenger of God Assembly, Adavi, Kogi state,&nbsp;Apostle Moses Abdullahi, said God has a purpose for Nigeria in view of the forthcoming general election. <a href=#>He further said President Jonathan is part of God’s plan for Nigeria.</a></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXOFlmtoZqiipL2psdNmrqGnXaW%2FprDInKuenF2Xwqmt0aKqZq6ZmMGwvthmqZ6ulZa5tHnAoJiipl6dwa64</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./urijah-faber-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Urijah Faber - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./409395-michael-b-jordan-net-worth-2021-house-salary-cars-billionaire-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michael B Jordan net worth 2021: house, salary, cars, billionaire</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
