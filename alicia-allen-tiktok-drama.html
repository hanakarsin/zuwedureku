But as any true millennial or Gen Zer knows, you can't completely erase something off the internet.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Alicia’s followers learned that she had participated in the challenge, which involves users making hand gestures and facial expressions that openly mock disabled people, all while dancing along to a parody song called "Let’s get retarded."</p><p>In response to the backlash she received after the discovery of her not-so-secret video, Alicia published two posts. The first simply shows the San Diego resident <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">silently crying</a> as Bon Iver and St. Vincent’s "Roslyn" plays in the background (talk about melodramatic).</p><p>The caption reads, "my following doesn’t make me any less human. It doesn’t make me any less susceptible to making mistakes. It doesn’t make me any better than anyone."</p><p>In the second, she offers up an actual apology. "I didn’t want to be one of those people," she begins, "but I made a video a few months ago that offended some people and I didn’t know that it would do that. And after realizing that it was offensive, I had taken it down and I hadn’t commented on it since."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aaliciaallen href=#>@aaliciaallen</a><p>for those who need to hear it.</p><a title="♬ original sound - aaliciaallen" href=#>♬ original sound - aaliciaallen</a></figure><p>Alicia claims to not have known what the challenge was when she filmed the video. "I didn’t think when I did it. I just did it ‘cause I thought it was funny," she admits. "And I’m sorry to everyone that I offended… I should’ve looked into the video and sound before I did it, and that was inconsiderate of me."</p><p>Despite the scandal, Alicia still hit three million followers after the response videos were shared. Thankfully, TikTok has disabled the hashtag "#autismchallenge" so that it can no longer be searched.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Alicia Allen has opened up about her deep-seated insecurities in the past.</h2><p>After reaching the three million follower mark on May 12, Alicia revealed that self-doubt is what led her to TikTok. "I used to think having Instagram followers was everything, and it wasn’t until I had caught myself editing my photos so MUCH that I realized how unhealthy it was for me, so I deleted it," she wrote in a series of captions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@aaliciaallen href=#>@aaliciaallen</a><p>it means more than u know</p><a title="♬ original sound - aaliciaallen" href=#>♬ original sound - aaliciaallen</a></figure><p>"I remained off of Instagram for a total of seven months and re-joined TikTok to pass time," she continued. "It wasn’t long before people started seeing me. More than anyone has ever seen me before, and it had me thinking… I can’t edit myself on here like I did on Instagram."</p><p>Alicia added, "You all helped me see that I had more to offer than physical appearance. So thank you all, SO much."</p><p>Here’s hoping Alicia now understands the responsibility (and accountability) that comes with having a huge platform.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmqr8iaZJqknJq7bsDIpKuoo12Zv6K5wA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ipob-family-reveals-what-dss-is-doing-to-nnamdi-kanu-in-custody.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Family Reveals What DSS Is Doing To Nnamdi Kanu In Custody</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-sofi-stadium-so-expensive.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The SoFi Stadium Is Nice, but Is It $5 Billion Nice?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
