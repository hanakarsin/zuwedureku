With his troubled past, and the secrets he is keeping from his fiancée, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Citra</a>, the pair has viewers on the edge of their seats.</p><p>The K-1 Visa process isn’t cheap, so Sam has had to work hard to get his fiancée to the United States. His hard work seems to be paying off, but many people are wondering what he does for a job. Keep reading for all of the details.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sam Wilson works as a stocker.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@cswlsn</a></figure><p>Sam is from Cameron, Mo. He has found himself at the center of attention on 90 Day Fiancé, not only for his romantic endeavors but also for his dedication to a demanding job. A glimpse into his daily life reveals the challenges he faces as a stocker for an online retailer.</p><p>The show provides viewers with a snapshot of Sam's mornings, waking up in his car, changing into work attire, and preparing for a day of loading and unloading packages at the docks. Despite the grueling nature of the job and the unconventional sleeping arrangements, Sam's commitment to supporting his relationship with Citra remains unwavering.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Despite a troubled past, Sam is now clean.</h2><p>Sam's journey hasn't been without its share of trials, particularly in overcoming a history of drug addiction. Having battled opiate dependency from the young age of 15, Sam faced a myriad of challenges that extended into his professional life, making job stability elusive. However, a turning point in his life occurred at the age of 22 when he managed to break free from the shackles of addiction.</p><p>In the years that followed, Sam not only remained clean but also embraced a new chapter marked by commitment and resilience. This triumph over personal demons became a crucial element of his relationship with Citra, who, despite being aware of his past, chose to stand by him as he pursued a healthier, drug-free lifestyle.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Citra (@cswlsn)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Sam has a big secret that Citra doesn't know about.</h2><p>Behind the veneer of commitment and redemption, a lingering secret threatens to unravel the stability Sam and Citra have built. Sam's arrest, a consequence of carrying Suboxone without a prescription, looms over his life.</p><p>The judge's offer of a diversion program served as a lifeline, providing an alternative to potential jail time. However, Sam's failure to meet the program's deadline places him at the precipice of a significant legal dilemma. The weight of this undisclosed information adds an extra layer of complexity to Sam's relationship with Citra, who remains blissfully unaware of the impending revelation.</p><p>Sam's dedication to his job as a stocker reflects his determination to build a stable future with Citra, but his legal issues could test the resilience of their love. It's a tale of love, redemption, and concealed truths! There's no telling how Citra and her dad — who is a cop — will react. Hopefully, Sam's legal issues don't get in the way of the couple's plan to get married within two weeks of Citra and her dad's arrival.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6uedaio6ynnmK3sK6McmdmnJGueqe1wKeang%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lauren-alaina-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lauren Alainas Debuted Her Future Husband at the Grand Ole Opry Who Is He?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kunal-beatbox-indian-matchmaking.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Beatbox Artist Kunal from 'Indian Matchmaking'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
