The girl's parents are real heroes because they do not let her lose heart. They support and protect her in every way. Adalia Rose mom is Natalia Pallante (Amuzurrutia nee). The name of her biological father is unknown, but her stepfather’s name is Ryan Pallante. Adalia Rose parents are just trying to live for today and give their daughter their joy in simple things.</p><p class=align-left>She is not the only child in the family.

She receives education, communicates with friends, and even maintains her personal blog on Instagram like an average teenager.</p><p class=align-left>The unusual girl loves to sing, dances with pleasure and likes to dress up.
