Whatever it is, that is the value of APC.</p><p>“So, we need to do a lot to build this party, and we need our youths more than ever before for them to continue with this legacy that this administration has established all over the country.</p><p>“That means we have to see ourselves as brothers and sisters regardless of where we come from.”</p><p>The Senate President recommended that all stakeholders must join hands and work together to ensure the APC remains the party of choice among Nigerians beyond 2023.</p><p>“Our tribe or even ethnic group, our religious persuasion should not matter when it comes to uniting this country.</p><p>“[And] as APC, the onus is on us to provide security and an economy that will bring growth and development to give people the kind of life that is meaningful.</p><p>“We can ask others to join us but we are the ones to do it, so we need all hands on deck,” he added.</p><p>The Senate President alleged that President Buhari couldn’t fulfil many of the campaign promises he made to Nigerians during his first term in office because of the disagreements between the leadership of the National Assembly and the Executive arm of government.</p><p>He however called for unity and synergy among the various arms of government to ensure projects and promises made to the electorates are delivered.</p><p>“When we were voted in 2019 as leaders of the National Assembly, we were conscious of one thing, that our mandate that was given to us by Nigerians in 2015 had suffered disruption and dislocation.</p><p>“For four years (2015 to 2019), our government could not perform optimally because of the then crisis between the parliament – the National Assembly – and the Executive arm of government.</p><p>“So, APC had already lost four very important years. And, that was supposed to be the years that we should have convinced Nigerians that they took the right decision by voting out a PDP administration in 2015.</p><p>“What are our options? We are one party in different arms of government. Our policies are supposed to be the same. Our programmes and projects are supposed to be the same, whether you’re in the legislature or the executive.</p><p>“So long as you are APC, that is your programme and project, that is your government and you are bound to make it succeed.</p><p>“So, we took the conscious decision of working in harmony that our relationship must be characterized by consultation, coordination, partnership and mutual respect, that we must succeed in the second tenure (2019 – 2023).</p><p>“Otherwise, in 2023, many would like to see our backs if you can’t provide the services expected of you in your first four years.</p><p>“[And] you to change and do better, why would anybody give you eight years?</p><p>“So, we felt we have an obligation to Nigerians who voted for us, to our people in APC and to our country, that we must work in such a fashion and manner that government is able to deliver services to Nigerians.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the Vice President of Nigeria, <strong>Prof Yemi Osinbajo</strong> has declared that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>the government needs the cooperation of the private sector</a></strong> to achieve anything meaningful with the economy.</p><p>Osinbajo noted that the organized private sector are partners in progress with the government.</p><p>He made the submission on Monday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja during a virtual interaction with representatives and business leaders from the organized private sector</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e5FrZpqok2LEqrjLZp2am5VisKmty6Wcp5%2BVqHq4tMSnZJutmJa%2FqnnLnpivnaNitq95kWlpbGWclsSiuo4%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./garrett-gilbert-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Garrett Gilbert - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./october13-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>October 13 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
