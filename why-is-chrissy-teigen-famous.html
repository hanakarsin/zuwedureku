But how did Chrissy become an A-list celebrity, and <a href=#>why is she famous in the first place?</a> Believe it or not, she actually made a name for herself before her marriage to John Legend — and she's still got more than one gig going for her right now to keep her in the spotlight.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Chrissy Teigen famous? She started as a model.</h2><p>While Chrissy was living in California with her family, a photographer was scouting new potential talent and took some photos of her while she was working her day job at a surf shop. After reviewing the photos, Chrissy decided to submit them to a modeling agency, who offered her a position with them.</p><p>From there, Chrissy went on to cover almost every popular magazine you can think of, starting with the cover of a Maxim calendar.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's your stereotypical, but usually too-good-to-be-true start, but it led her to the covers of Vogue, Glamour, and even Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue, where she was labeled their "Rookie of the Year."</p><p>Chrissy also had a deal as a substitute briefcase model in 2006 and 2007, before she started appearing on covers. This is also where she crossed passed with Meghan Markle while she was also a briefcase model.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She met John while shooting for one of his music videos.&nbsp;</h2><p>Chrissy starred in <a href=#>John Legend's music video</a> for his song "Stereo," and that's reportedly how the two of them met. At the time, Chrissy was definitely more well-recognized than John was, but the two hit it off and dated for a few years before marrying in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Chrissy is recognized frequently as one-half of the power couple, but even though she stopped modeling a while ago, she's still got enough gigs under her belt to keep her in the A-list category.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Chrissy became a lifestyle guru once she published her cookbook.</h2><p>After the birth of her first child, Luna, Chrissy started working on a cookbook, titled <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cravings: Recipes for All the Foods You Want to Eat</a>. The cookbook, which was released in 2016, launched her as a lifestyle guru, and she's continued to share insights into her life and, of course, even more food content.</p><p>Chrissy's followup cookbook, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cravings: Hungry for More</a>, was released in September 2018.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She's also had a few stints as television show hosts.</h2><p>Even before her cookbook work, Chrissy has done a few <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hosting gigs</a>, initially appearing as a judge on America's Next Top Model in 2011, before her marriage to John. She's also made appearances as a host on shows like The View, and had a few acting gigs. Some of her most-known work includes her gigs as Crystal in Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation and in Between Two Ferns: The Movie.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJygop7AtMWMrZyin5WjeqetzKisrA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./february22-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>February 22 Horoscope and Zodiac</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-does-sos-cuba-mean.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Does &amp;quot;SOS Cuba&amp;quot; Mean?
