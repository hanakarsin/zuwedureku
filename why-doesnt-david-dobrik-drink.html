The YouTube Star Knows His Limits With Alcohol</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Michelle Stein</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated Aug. 17 2020, 4:06 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Ilya S. Savenok/Getty</span></figure><p>Plenty of people in this world enjoy alcohol — whether it's a glass of wine with dinner, grabbing a couple of beers while catching up with a friend, or the occasional all-out party. At the same time, there are also individuals who choose to abstain from alcohol for one reason or another. And fans of YouTube star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Dobrik</a> have always wondered: why doesn't David drink?</p><p>David, who was born in Slovakia but grew up in the U.S., got his start on the now-defunct Vine. It wasn't until 2016 that he started his YouTube channel. These days, he has amassed an impressive 15.9 million followers, making him one of the biggest vloggers on the platform.</p><p>Although the 23-year-old films plenty of drunk people for his YouTube videos, it turns out that he himself doesn't actually drink. This is pretty shocking to many of his followers, who have just one question: why?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Steven Ferdman/Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why doesn't David Dobrik drink?</h2><p>In Dec. 2018, David sat down and answered some of the most-searched questions about himself in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video for Wired</a>. And one of the very last questions addressed why he avoids alcohol. Answering in the third person, the YouTuber explained, "Because he's scared. He's scared of what he will do under the influence of alcohol. And he can't handle his liquor. After David Dobrik has one beer, David Dobrik has to go nap-nap."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>I mean, he does have a valid point; drinking can have some pretty heavy consequences. And David would know. A number of his videos features the out-of-control partying of his friends, which often ends in someone getting hurt or looking completely ridiculous. Take this March 2018 YouTube video titled, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">THIS IS WHY YOU SHOULDNT DRINK!!</a>" for example.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Still, David doesn't abstain completely from alcohol.</h2><p>It's worth noting that David is what many might call a social drinker — because apparently he does have a beer from time to time. During a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wingstop mukbang with Josh Peck</a> in 2018, he mentioned in passing what he had eaten for dinner the night before. “I had a Corona Light with Chex Mix, and I was watching Storage Wars,” he shared.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Another thing: David isn't a citizen.</h2><p>Another reason David doesn't drink might have something to do with his citizenship status — or rather, his lack thereof. "I'm not allowed to leave the country because I'm under what you would call DACA," he answered in response to being asked if he was going to tour in Australia. "Because then if I leave, I can't re-enter for another 10 years." He also went on to say, "I'm not a citizen and I don't have a visa."</p><p>Assuming David enjoys living in Los Angeles with his friends and living the content creator life, it makes sense that he wouldn't risk possibly getting into trouble with the law as the result of having too much to drink.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Natalie offered to pay for lunch then proceeded to use my credit card hahah</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>DAVID DOBRIK</a> (@daviddobrik) on Feb 12, 2020 at 1:11pm PST</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Personally, I commend David for knowing his limits and making the conscious choice not to drink to the point of drunkenness. Whatever his reasons may be — whether it's learning from past mistakes, not seeing the point of drinking, or wanting to play it safe because of his lack of citizenship — David's habits surrounding alcohol should be respected. You do you, man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKympGKxosLInWSdp5Kntqx5w6ugp6M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-we-moved-our-head-office-to-lagos-from-abuja-faan-reveals.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Why We Moved Our Head Office To Lagos From Abuja</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-a-durast-shadow-and-bone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Is a Durast in 'Shadow and Bone'?
