Due to the nature of bipartisan politics in America, with two major parties struggling to gain as much power as possible, people are going to pick sides, which may be why people are wondering if <a href=#>Biden</a> was wired during the debates.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was Biden wired during his first presidential debate with Donald Trump?</h2><p>"Joe Biden doesn't know he's alive!" said President Trump multiple times leading up to the 2020 election. A staunch narrative from Trump's administration, conservative media outlets, and various Trump supporters and republicans is that Joe Biden is mentally unfit to serve as president of the United States. This led many folks to theorize that Joe would not be able to string any coherent thoughts together during the verbal contest.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Both Trump and Biden got their personal barbs in at one another during the debate: it wasn't the "dignified" type of discussion one would expect of a prestigious office but then again, politics haven't really been the same ever since Donald Trump became president. Taking "the high road" didn't necessarily work out so well for Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden didn't seem to have a problem with attempting to talk over Donald Trump throughout the debate and vice-versa.</p><p>Since Joe's mental acuity was called into question several times leading up to the debate, with many theorizing he would even attempt to "pull out" of the back-and-forth with Trump, lots of folks were surprised to see him not get verbally steamrolled by Trump and wonder if he was wearing a wire during the debate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Biden was wired. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LzHePYCBgQ</a></p>— ]intheMatrixxx[ (@intheMatrixxx) <a href=#>September 30, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Is this an led light from a wire device?

The "microphone" in his wrist was possibly a pen.</p><p>Why he would have a microphone in there is kinda crazy to begin with, it's not like he's going to be able to say anything into his hand on national television, and it's not like whoever's feeding him lines can't hear what he's saying at the podium anyway.</p><p>The "wire theory" comes mostly from folks who couldn't believe that Joe didn't absolutely crap the bed during the debate.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>JOE BIDEN CAUGHT RED HANDED WEARING A WIRE Why was Joe Biden not fumbling his words as much during the presidential...</p>Posted by <a href=# role=button>Scott L.
