In fact, from her first and second marriages combined, Queen Consort Camilla has 10 grandchildren.</p><p>Prior to her marriage to King Charles III, Queen Consort Camilla was married to <a href=#>Andrew Parker Bowles</a> from 1973-1995. The two of them <a href=#>share two children</a> named Tom and Laura, with Tom being a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">godson</a> to King Charles III — and there are several grandchildren on that side.</p><p>Once she and King Charles III married in 2005, <a href=#>Prince William</a> and <a href=#>Prince Harry</a> were already in their twenties, and her first grandchild from her second marriage would be born eight years later.</p><p>Despite the rules and obligations of the <a href=#>British royal family</a>, Queen Consort Camilla seemingly does not play favorites, and her grandchildren from her first marriage even participated in the historic May 6, 2023 <a href=#>coronation</a>.</p><p>With a number of grandchildren included in the festivities, here are details below about Queen Consort Camilla's grandchildren.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Camilla Parker Bowles has five grandchildren from her first marriage.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a><p>Prince Harry, page boy Tom Pettifer, and Eliza Lopes on Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding day in London in 2011</p></figure><p>Camilla gave birth to Tom and Laura in 1974 and 1978, respectively. Tom, a food writer, went on to marry fashion editor Sara Buys in September 2005 (they are now divorced) and they share two children together — a daughter named Lola and a son named Freddy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Laura married chartered accountant Harry Lopes in 2006, with whom she shares three children — a daughter named Eliza and twin boys Gus and Louis.</p><p>Eliza gained popularity due to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">participation</a> in <a href=#>Prince William and Kate Middleton</a>'s wedding in 2011, where she served as a junior attendant. However, it was Freddy, Gus, and Louis who shined at the coronation, as the three of them were pages of honor for Queen Consort Camilla.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Camilla Parker Bowles has five grandchildren from her second marriage.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Getty Images</a><p>Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Kate Middleton, Prince William, Lord Oliver Cholmondeley, Prince George, Nicholas Barclay and Ralph Tollemache on the balcony of Buckingham Palace during the Coronation on May 6, 2023</p></figure><p>Prince William and Prince Harry are the famous sons of King Charles III that have been in the spotlight for their entire lives.
