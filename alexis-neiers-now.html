"F---ing b--ch!"</p><p>The iconic moment was captured for all to see in Pretty Wild, an E! reality show that followed the aftermath of Alexis' arrest and her involvement in the prosecution of the "Bling Ring" scandal.</p><p>"What happened on the first day of filming, the police showed up at our door and arrested Alexis," her mother Andrea Arlington recalled to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>. "Now what nobody knows is that [Alexis] and Tess actually called into the police and reported the entire 'Bling Ring' group of people at the time to the North Hollywood Police Department."</p><p>Now, Alexis has made a complete transformation: She's a drug and alcohol counselor, and married with kids.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><p>Alexis, now Alexis Haines, got sober after being arrested for possession of a controlled substance while on probation for her participating in the "Bling Ring." These days, she's put the entire ordeal behind her. "I really don't feel like I'm such a big part of pop culture," she said last year.&nbsp;</p><p>"I've never read the Bling Ring book. I've never seen The Bling Ring movie," she revealed. "I've always just kind of stood in my truth and since getting sober in 2010, if I go back to those dark moments in my life, then I just get sucked in and engulfed in that."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Alexis' husband, Evan Haines?</h2><p>Alexis and Evan met in Alcoholics Anonymous and tied the knot in 2012 in Mexico.

Harper is excited for homeschool. This was a decision we made before covid hit, so I was already prepping for this transition. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Our homeschool room is coming along. I‚Äôve added a story highlight for you all to see what I‚Äôve been planning. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be sending Dakota back to preschool or not. It is such a tough call. Our numbers have been rising here and while we‚Äôre doing better than most of California, I‚Äôm not taking chances. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ We are in the process of our home study for adoption. I am so looking forward to that being completed. I was speaking to a potential birth mother who was due in September and because of covid we probably won‚Äôt have our home study complete by then. But that‚Äôs okay, I know the perfect baby/babies are coming our way. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ Evan has been so busy writing his first book. Y‚Äôall, when I say this book is going to be a complete game changer in the way we view mental health and addiction, I‚Äôm not messing around. I can‚Äôt wait for you to get your hands on it. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ I have some super exciting guests coming on the podcast soon! I can‚Äôt wait for you guys to listen. Tomorrow‚Äôs guest is @shamandurek and I had a massive breakthrough on this episode with him. Total game changer. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ And that‚Äôs where we are at. Taking this day by day. I‚Äôm certainly feeling the effects of missing friends and human connection, but taking this opportunity to grow within myself. ‚Å£ ‚Å£ How are you all doing?</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>A L E X I S H A I N E S</a> (@itsalexishaines) on Jul 19, 2020 at 10:00am PDT</p></figure><p>After leaving rehab, Alexis went back to school to become a drug and alcohol counselor, and she now runs Malibu's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alo House Recovery Centers</a>, which Evan co-founded in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple have two children: Harper Elisabeth, now seven, and Dakota, nicknamed Coco.</p><p>The kids are coming to learn about their mother's past life.
