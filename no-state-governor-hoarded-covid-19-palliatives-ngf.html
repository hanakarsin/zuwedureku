The forum revealed this in a statement titled, <strong>‘Governors and the CACOVID Palliatives,’</strong> signed by the Head, Media and Public Affairs of the NGF, Abudulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, Naija News reports.</p><p>The statement reads; “The NGF regrets the loss of lives and property occasioned by the violent protests that erupted, and calls for calm. The NGF reemphasises and corrects the impression that palliatives found in warehouses that were broken into in Lagos and some other states were kept in storage for members of the society, especially our vulnerable citizens.”</p><p>“The erroneous impression in the public domain that these palliatives were hoarded is not just inaccurate, entirely erroneous and untrue but also mischievous, to say the least.”</p><p>“For the avoidance of doubt, some of the palliatives had the CACOVID stamp embossed on them, meaning that their source is unambiguous,”&nbsp;Bello-Barkindo noted.</p><p>“As we know, CACOVID operations are mainly domiciled in Lagos, being the headquarters of most of the public-spirited organisations, corporate bodies and individuals that came together to form the Coalition Against COVID-19 -CACOVID.</p><p>“Until mid-October, when the NGF had its last meeting, up to ten states had not participated in the flag-off ceremonies for the distribution of palliatives in their states. This was because the items meant for distribution in these states had not been completely received from CACOVID.</p><p>“Some other states that still had palliatives in their warehouses chose to keep a strategic reserve ahead of a projected second wave of COVID-19. As of a couple of weeks ago, some states were still receiving palliatives from the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development.”</p><p>The NGF insisted that no state has been involved in or has hoarded any palliatives, assuring all contributors to the palliatives that prior to the looting of these warehouses, states had kept full accounts of all the items received and distributed.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>a&nbsp;woman, living in Akwa-Ibom has narrated how she discovered she has been buying&nbsp;COVID-19&nbsp;palliatives</strong></a></p><p>The woman claimed to have peeled off the sticker on the carton of noodles she bought and discovered it was supposed to be for the Covid-19 palliatives.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH5xe5FvZqenXajBosDEZp6orpWnu7C%2BjKGmmqqUmrFur86voJ1lYW56sa3LpaCarJmrsrR5zaCdaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./helen-paul.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Read All The Latest News About Helen Paul On Naija News</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./homeless-man-manchester-bombing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Homeless Man Who Tended To Victims Of Manchester Bombing Given Place To Live</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
