One little kid, Christian Moore, only 8 years old, recently demonstrated just how awesome he was when he befriended a classmate with autism on the first day of school.</p><p>The first day of school for anyone in any grade is a big deal, and it can be totally overwhelming. For Connor Crites, also 8 years old and a rising second-grader at Minneha Elementary School in Wichita, Kansas, the first day of school was proving to be a little too much to handle, and he started crying.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>That's when Christian found and held his hand to be his buddy and make him feel better. Christian's mom took this sweet picture and posted it to Facebook along with the story. "I'm so proud of my son," Courtney Coko Moore wrote on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a>. "He seen a kid balled up into a corner crying, so he went to console him, grabbed his hand, and walked him inside of the school!</p><p>"It is an honor to raise such a loving, compassionate child," she continued. "He's a kid with a big heart, the first day of school started off right." I'll say! Christian's gesture of kindness was so simple. He didn't know Connor. He just saw a kid in need.</p><p>Courtney's post about Christian went super viral, and then Connor's mom and grandmother reached out in the comments to share just how much it meant to them that Christian helped Connor when he was upset.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Connor's mom April explained that he has autism and she often worries that he's going to be bullied for being different. But the way Christian helped him makes her feel a little less scared for her son.&nbsp;</p><p>"That's all I can ask for, is someone to be open to him like that," April told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>. "I'm so happy that something so positive is coming from all this, that my son got a friend, hopefully a friend for life." Connor was nonverbal until he was 5 years old, and April worries every day that he'll be laughed at or mocked.&nbsp;</p><p>But now, he's got an inseparable bond with an awesome friend. Connor spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a> about his new friend: "He was kind to me. I was in the first day of school and I started crying. Then he helped me and I was happy."</p><p>It didn't register to Christian that Connor was different in any way. He just saw a kid who was upset and overwhelmed and needed a friend, so he walked over on his own and took his hand. "He found me and held my hand and I got happy tears," Connor said. We got happy tears too, Connor.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Courtney, April, and the boys were interviewed together for ABC News. It was clear the boys didn't think of themselves as extraordinary; they really just wanted to get back to playing together. And that's the whole point of this story.</p><p>"It doesn't matter, color, it doesn't matter, gender, it doesn't matter, disability, and it doesn't matter anything," April said. "Just be kind, open your heart. It's what we need in this world."</p><p>"One act of kindness can change someone's life," Courtney added.</p><p>As for Connor and Christian, they were fast friends and they love playing together. Christian's advice to others is really very simple when you think about it: "Be nice." It should be that easy, shouldn't it?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm7azv9Nmm5qxXaSzbr%2FCoaaopF2bv6qxzZ2qZpmlqba0uQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alaya-high-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>That Girl Lay Lay - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./northern-forum-demands-resignation-of-aviation-minister-central-bank-governor-over-relocation-of-faan-cbn-head-offices-to-lagos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Northern Forum Demands Resignation Of Aviation Minister, Central Bank Governor Over Relocation Of FA</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
