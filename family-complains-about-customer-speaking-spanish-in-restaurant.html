The man asks the woman to step away from the table but there appears to be further disagreement between the three of them.</p><p>The woman in the pink shirt doesn't go back to her table until the man stands up aggressively to face her but the woman doesn't back away and continues to talk to him.</p><p>In a follow-up, video @chill_gamer explains that the woman in the pink shirt is his mother. What appears to have happened is that the TikToker's family were sitting with one another and speaking Spanish among each other.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chill__gamer2 href=#>@chill__gamer2</a><p>Its really sad how much this happens to us <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=racist href=#>#racist</a> <a title=hispanic href=#>#hispanic</a><a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - chill_gamer" href=#>♬ original sound - chill_gamer</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>From other TikToks, it seems that the complaint was about the fact that the TikToker's family was speaking loudly, and not necessarily because they were speaking in Spanish. However, @chill_gamer says that they've received several complaints in the past when they've been out to eat over the fact that they're speaking to one another in a language other than English.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chill__gamer2 href=#>@chill__gamer2</a><p>Replying to @stteck63 also sorry for my studering i do have a issue with it. <a title=racist href=#>#racist</a> <a title=latino href=#>#latino</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=explained href=#>#explained</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - chill_gamer" href=#>♬ original sound - chill_gamer</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>In a detailed "story time" post he delineates exactly what happened in the clip. "Here you can see there is two parties. The woman standing up is my mom the offended the family sitting down is the offender."</p><p>He said that they were seated in a loud restaurant and that there was "obviously a lot of noise" and "stuff going on" as a result.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chill__gamer2 href=#>@chill__gamer2</a><p>Replying to @itsesmeep i didnt get all of it because I couldn't find my phone<a title=racist href=#>#racist</a> <a title=latino href=#>#latino</a><a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=sad href=#>#sad</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - chill_gamer" href=#>♬ original sound - chill_gamer</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>He said that the man approached their table while they were talking in Spanish and listening to a message, presumably on a cell phone, from the TikToker's aunt. He said that the demeanor in which the man was asking them to be quiet was more of a commanding tone as opposed to an apologetic ask. Which prompted the woman in the pink shirt, @chill_gamer's mom to confront the dad about it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chill__gamer2 href=#>@chill__gamer2</a><p>By the way my mom is the one in the pink who is defending herself after the man got disrespectful <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=racist href=#>#racist</a> <a title=hispanic href=#>#hispanic</a> <a title=latino href=#>#latino</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=sad href=#>#sad</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - chill_gamer" href=#>♬ original sound - chill_gamer</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>He said that she asked the man why they were the only table he decided to get up and tell him to be quiet in the loud and bustling restaurant while there were other people at other tables making noise as well. He also points out that the man gets up in an attempt to intimidate his mom while her son sits at the table and records their interaction.</p><p>It's at this point that the woman begins to raise her voice because the man, according to the TikToker tells her to "get the f*** out of here."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>TikTokers who saw the post had varied opinions on what went down. Some remarked that it appeared that the complaint was more about the fact that they were listening to messages from his aunt and playing it at a loud volume and the fact that they were speaking Spanish was irrelevant.</p><p>However, there were others who believed that it wasn't OK for a younger man to attempt to silence a woman who was older than him and some were convinced this was a case of overt racism in action.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>Some just thought the fact that the man stepped to his mother in such an aggressive way would be a one-way ticket to him getting his lights punched out.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @chill_gamer</span></figure><p>What do you think about the situation? Should the table have just complained to restaurant management about the noise level in the premises? Was the table in the wrong for the way they approached @chill_gamer's family's table? Have you seen people discriminated against in public for speaking a language different from the dominant dialect folks are speaking in a particular region?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfm66utcuyZJynnaW5orXNrGSamp%2BqwW6v1KyrqKWVp3q0vMSaoqKml2LAsa3NoqqhZZmjerOx0q2YrqqRo8E%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./homeless-man-manchester-bombing.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Homeless Man Who Tended To Victims Of Manchester Bombing Given Place To Live</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-lamidi-adedibu-gave-oyo-to-pdp-in-2003-obasanjo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Lamidi Adedibu Gave Oyo To PDP In 2003</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
