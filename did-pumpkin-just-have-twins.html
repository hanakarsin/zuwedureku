After June‚Äôs drug addiction spun out of control, Pumpkin and her husband, <a href=#>Josh Efird</a>, stepped up in her absence. In June 2022, Pumpkin got full custody of her little sister ‚Äî and as a result, a pretty full house.</p><p>Now, their family has gotten even bigger as Pumpkin just had twins! The news comes not long after the birth of their now almost 1-year-old son, Bentley. How many kids does Lauryn have now? Distractify spoke exclusively with the busy mom to learn more about how she is adjusting to having "three under one."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@pumpkin</a><p>Ella Grace Efird, Josh Efird, Bentley Efird, and Pumpkin Efird</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">How many kids do ‚ÄòMama June: Road to Redemption‚Äôs' Lauryn Shannon and her husband, Josh Efird, have?</h2><p>Josh and Pumpkin dated for less than a year before he popped the question. While Lauryn was only 16 at the time, the two planned to tie the knot as soon as she turned 18. And in 2018, they did exactly that in Las Vegas. Months before tying the knot, the couple welcomed their now 4-year-old daughter, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ella Grace Efird</a>.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt until April of 2021 that she announced that she and her husband were expecting baby No. 2. Only a few months later, Pumpkin gave birth to baby <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bentley Jameson Efird</a>.</p><p>On <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, she posted a picture of the newborn that was captioned, ‚ÄúAfter being admitted into the hospital last night at 2-3 centimeters with heavy contractions, our baby boy has finally made his debut.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Page Six (@pagesix)</a></p></figure><p>Not long after, outlets reported that the couple was growing their family. Along with winning their months-long custody battle against June, Pumpkin and Josh also welcomed twins! Now, Pumpkin has sole custody of her younger sister and she's raising four other children.</p><p>She shared with us that raising five kids (which includes 17-year-old Alana) is a "full-time job." And there are no plans for a sixth child.</p><p>"Oh, no no," Pumpkin told us when asked if she wants another baby after the birth of her twins. "I got my tubes tied."</p><p>So that settles that. But she will be busy with diapers and college applications for the foreseeable future with her three youngest and with Alana gearing up for the next step of her own life.</p><p>Pumpkin is also the sole caregiver for Alana. Between being in her early twenties and raising a teenager and taking care of four small children, Pumpkin keeps pretty busy both on and off the show.</p><p>So it's not a huge surprise that she made the decision not to have any more children after her twins were born.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Lauryn Efirdüå∫ (@pumpkin)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Where are Pumpkin's twins?</h2><p>Pumpkin shares her life on reality TV as well as social media. And while she doesn't plan to keep her twins off Instagram forever, there‚Äôs a reason the newest tiny additions to her family aren‚Äôt all over her profile.</p><p>‚ÄúAt first, it was just more so, just like, all celebrities [refrain from posting],‚Äù Pumpkin said. ‚ÄúYou let the outlets get the pictures first.
