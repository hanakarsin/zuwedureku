In many areas you can even order your weekly groceries online. But as virtually everyone who shops online has discovered at some point, shopping by product pictures alone can lead to frustrating and often hilarious incidences of "expectation vs. reality." disappointment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Like this $10 chair that was too good to be true.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Amazon</span></figure><p>Who hasn't thought they found a great deal when in reality the item is much smaller than expected? A lot of Amazon shoppers were duped by this acrylic doll-sized chair, thinking it was regular human-sized. And who could blame them? Looking at this photo, there's no way of knowing the size. It's not until you see it in perspective that you get <a href=#>just how tiny that chair is</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP"></h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Thankfully, it seems like Amazon has been a bit better about monitoring for deceptive advertising, as chairs like this on the site now indicate "miniature" or "doll" in the product name.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It's the latest trend in festival fashion: wearable tents.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>This poor guy thought he'd purchased a two-person tent. He had. It's just those two people are most likely under the age of 10. Still, he says he brought it to the festival he purchased it for anyway. Those are some very cozy accommodations.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">"Area" rug doesn't specify the actual area it covers...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Poor Adam here bought a rug on Amazon to cover a stain on his light-colored carpeting. Unfortunately, the rug he received doesn't quite cover it. He probably should have suspected the $6 price tag was too good to be true, but honestly, for $6 I'd expect it to at least be bigger than an envelope. To his credit, Adam was duped by a dishonest reseller, who didn't disclose what the rug's manufacturer clearly states in their description: it's meant for a dollhouse.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Have yourself a very little Christmas.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>My 4-foot artificial tree from Amazon definitely felt a bit smaller than I'd wanted, even as an apartment dweller. But after seeing this model, I'll stop complaining. Not only is this absolutely swimming in tree skirt, but if you were to put the Santa figurine on the hearth next to it, it would be like a Godzilla Christmas special.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She said she wanted her wedding to be a "small, intimate affair."</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>This Instagrammer thought she'd found a great deal on candelabras for her bridal table. Well, maybe if she got some birthday candles these could do? Still, it's pretty unlikely these will work for her wedding tablescape.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sometimes, the item you get is too big.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Like way too big.</p><p>These pants also look like they were made for Barbie — if a life-size woman with Barbie proportions existed. I have seen a few women with legs long enough for these pants. They are models.</p><p>For a time, shoppers of UK retailer Pretty Little Thing were taking to Twitter to show off how comically long their flared trousers were on people who aren't 6-foot-tall Glamazons.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Teddy Long Legs</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>This bear should probably order the pants above. They'd definitely fit. To be fair, the seller does say it's 6'5" tall, but seated there in the grass it certainly does look less.... leggy.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This is a Jurassic fail.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Clearly, most people who saw this product photo would expect to get a cute dino-shaped pillow in the mail, instead of the weird meta pillowcase they received. Still, if I got this, I'm not sure I'd even be mad. I doubt I'd return it for a refund, because the laughs and novelty alone are worth whatever the price. I might even order a few more so I could have a full set for my bed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">For finger food!</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: imgur</a></figure><p>Looking at the photo on the right, you can tell this is a small skillet, but most sane people would assume the stuffed tomato is your typical beefsteak variety and the soft-cooked egg beside it is a chicken egg. Clearly, this seller moonlights for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiny Kitchen</a> and went to the trouble of stuffing a cherry tomato and poaching a quail egg just to pull off this perspective goof. I'm not even mad, I'm impressed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Sometimes you don't get what you paid for...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Thank goodness eBay has protections against scams like this, but let this be a warning to you sneakerheads out there: if you're shopping for limited edition kicks as coveted as these, don't buy from a seller with zero ratings, lest you end up with a pair of Yeezy novelty slippers. instead.</p><p>These aren't the only online shoppers who got sold a false bill of goods. Sometimes you really don't get what you asked for.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">This face mask really REALLY makes your pores smaller.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>Look, there's not enough beauty products out there for the shrunken-head set, so this seller clearly saw a consumer demand and met it. It's not their fault if people just assume the proportions are for non-witch doctor survivors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">I have questions...</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>First off, the quote is "you can't sit with us," so both shirts are wrong. Yes, I realize that's not a question. Second of all, am I wrong in saying the image on the shirt on the right is better? All I'm saying is, if you combine the best parts of these shirts, you've got yourself a pretty cool shirt.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Good grief.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: reddit</a></figure><p>What really sucks here is this is a sympathy arrangement. The person who purchased the bouquet was expecting the beautiful, tasteful one on the right to express their profound sympathies. Instead, their aunt got the one on the left. Sure, it's not the worst bouquet I've ever seen, but when You want tasteful minimalism and get a baby's breath bomb tied together with a cheap satin bow, you're probably not going to be super pleased.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Trick or treat.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>You think you found an awesome deal on a Deadpool costume. And then the mail arrives. Reddit user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Origami_girl</u></a> said it best with the one-word caption "Derpool." Hard to believe, but the retailer where this monstrosity originated is no longer in business. Go figure!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2008 vs. 2019</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>My theory is that the patch used to look like the one on the left but the seller decided, with our current geopolitical climate being what it is, the sentiment needed an update.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Rebel Girl</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><p>Well, that certainly is a subversive plot twist — although, if the mom who purchased it had been more familiar with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">meme culture</a>, she may have been less surprised at what came in the mail. While the good-humored mom insists her child won't wear the shirt out of the house, I say, why not? Also, is this available in adult sizes?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLuttc2eZKygn6W9qrrGZqerp5SqsLV5w56qnKqZpcGqu82s</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./10th-national-assembly-to-be-inaugurated-tuesday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>10th National Assembly To Be Inaugurated Tuesday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./412862-prince-william-slams-bbc-over-princess-diana-interview-says-it-worsened-his-parents-relationship-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Prince William Slams BBC over Princess Diana Interview, Says It Worsened His Parents' Relationship</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
