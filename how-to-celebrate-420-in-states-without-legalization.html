How on earth can you celebrate <a href=#>4/20</a> in conditions where a toke could land you in prison?</p><p>Don't fret. We've got some ways you can enjoy the highest of holidays in a perfectly fun (and legal) manner. There's a THC substitute out there that has gives users the similar, calming effect of weed, without the high that could land you in legal trouble.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sugar and Kush</span><p>Sugar and Kush has a variety of THC-free options.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are a variety of CBD products on the market.</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayo Clinic</a>, CBD is a chemical found in marijuana. However, "CBD doesn't contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient found in marijuana that produces a high." While CBD is legal in all 50 states, states that haven't legalized marijuana have their own rules on what qualifies as legal CBD. You can refer to this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Health Canal</a> report to check on what qualifies as legal CBD in your state.</p><p>Now that you've verified how your state views CBD, it's time to start shopping! There are several online stores that sell fun CBD products for all sorts of needs. Do you struggle with anxiety and want a product that'll last you past 4/20? CBD oil is worth a try. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar and Kush</a> offers CBD oil in sweet flavors, like cotton candy, hazelnut, vanilla, bubble gum, and orange creamsicle.</p><p>You can take the CBD by itself, or even add it to your first or second daily coffee (if you know, you know). For a sweeter treat this 4/20, give <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sugar and Kush's low-sugar CBD cookies</a> a try. They have flavors like birthday cake, chocolate chip, and cookies-n-cream.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Exhale Well</span><p>Vapes aren't just for THC!</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Do you miss vaping?</h2><p>If you miss vaping your favorite THC product, especially on 4/20, don't fret. There are a lot of high quality CBD vape substitutes on the market that contain zero THC, but that are still supposed to have a calming effect.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Exhale Vape</a> for example, sells a variety of flavored CBD vapes that contain zero THC.</p><p>As the company states on its website, "Our specialized CBD vape juice formula includes pure, CO2-extracted, hemp extract (broad spectrum), and the best natural terpenes which results in a delicious and powerfully effective blend."</p><p>Exhale Vape has a large assortment of CBD vape cartridge flavors. We'd recommend the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pineapple Express</a> flavor for 4/20 celebrations!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">CBD can be beneficial 365 days of the year.</h2><p>Fun 4/20 celebrations aside, CBD can help users who have anxiety, chronic pain, and more. If you're not into oils, vaping, or cookies (seriously though, who doesn't like cookies?), you can always try CBD capsules, creams, gummies, or salves.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBDistillery</span><p>A lot of CBD capsules are combined with other healthy ingredients.</p></figure><p>CBD capsules that are blended with other healthy ingredients are a popular option for those who are more interested in the ingredient's health benefits. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBDistillery</a>'s "Functional Synergy" capsules have a combination of CBD and CBG (another component of the marijuana plant that does not make you high), along with Lions Mane and Cordyceps mushrooms. The combination is supposed to help you focus so you don't have to rely on your two-coffee-a-day habit!</p><p>These CBDistillery capsules contain less than .3% THC.</p><p>We know 4/20 can be hard when there isn't a dispensary a short drive away, but there's a whole bevy of comparable CBD/CBG products out there to enjoy, from chocolate and skincare, to pain creams.</p><p>Here's to a happy and legal 4/20, wherever you are!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZJydnJqvs63TnmRtamBitq950q2YrZ2jYsSqwMeorK1lnJq0orjIs5itoZ%2Bj</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./webseries.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mani - Cast, Ages, Trivia</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./barcelona-reveals-they-have-reached-an-agreement-with-neymar.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Barcelona Reveals They Have Reached An Agreement With Neymar</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
