Here's what we know about whether the shoot was even more complicated than many originally thought.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Was Blake Lively pregnant while filming 'It Ends With Us?'</h2><p><a href=#>Blake and her husband Ryan Reynolds have four children together</a>, and when Blake was originally cast in the role, she was still pregnant with her youngest child. By the time the movie started filming, though, she had had the baby. In short, then, Blake was not pregnant during filming for the movie.</p><p>Given that Blake was just a few months away from having a baby during the shoot, though, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> has suggested that she was still sensitive about her weight.</p><p>During one key scene in which Justin lifts her up in the air, he reportedly asked how much she weighed, which led Blake to feel like she had been fat-shamed.</p><p>Ultimately, though, it doesn't seem like that is the extent of the feud that has emerged in the press over the movie. While no one is speaking openly about it, it seems like quite a bit of arguing happened on the set of the movie as it was filming.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni apparently argued over the film itself.</h2><p>News broke in August that <a href=#>Justin had hired the crisis PR firm</a> that represented Johnny Depp in his trial against Amanda Heard (a great sign), but it's unclear exactly what shoe he might be expecting to drop.</p><p>Most of the reporting to date has suggested that Justin and Blake fought over the direction of the movie, and Blake, who served as a producer on the film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commissioned her own cut of it</a> after hiring Shane Reid, the editor who had worked on Deadpool & Wolverine.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@jillaferr href=#>@jillaferr</a><p>Feel like Gossip Girl having the scoop on <a title=itendswithus href=#>#itendswithus</a> drama üòè <a title=justinbaldoni href=#>#justinbaldoni</a> <a title=blakelively href=#>#blakelively</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ It Ends With Us is in Theaters August 9 - It Ends With Us" href=#>‚ô¨ It Ends With Us is in Theaters August 9 - It Ends With Us</a></figure><p>Fans have also noted that none of the cast of the film follows Baldoni on social media, and that Baldoni and Blake have not done any press together to promote the film.</p><p>In speaking with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, Baldoni suggested that there is ‚Äúalways friction that happens when you make a movie like this,‚Äù but added that that friction is what ‚Äúcreates the beautiful art.‚Äù</p><p>It seems like this story is very much still unfolding, and every twist and turn seems to suggest that there may be another shoe to drop. Blake was definitely not pregnant on the set of the movie, but that doesn't mean that everything was smooth sailing either during production or while the movie was being edited.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60ecGlmKSdXaG2t7HLsmSpqpWcu6K602auoaGcmnqntcumoKefXZ7BbrHNnapmr5mptW7B0g%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-preciado-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eddie Preciado - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./video-suspected-kidnappers-nabbed-by-security-operatives.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Suspected Kidnappers Nabbed By Security Operatives</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
