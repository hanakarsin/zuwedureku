Part of Devi's drama involves new girl, Aneesa, whom her fellow classmates consider to be the newer, better version of Devi.</p><p>And although the actress who plays <a href=#>Aneesa</a> in Never Have I Ever, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Suri</a>, might not feel the same way, she does have a special attachment to the series.</p><p>Megan was a fan of Never Have I Ever before she was cast as Aneesa and now, some fans are pretty enamored with the actress. Never Have I Ever fans are not only asking if Aneesa will be in future seasons but also who she is outside of the show. Here's what we know about the rising star.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who plays Aneesa in 'Never Have I Ever'?</h2><p>Megan Suri was cast as Aneesa in Season 2, and, for her, it was basically a dream come true. Megan explained to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PopSugar</a> that she had been a fan of the show before she was cast, and she even watched the entire second season before it dropped on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. It's safe to say she's still a fan, but for different reasons now that she is one of the breakout stars of the series.</p><p>But before Never Have I Ever, Aneesa was in a ton of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other TV shows</a>, some of which you might recognize her from. Megan was in episodes of Fresh off the Boat and How to Get Away With Murder, and she had a recurring role in Atypical. She was also in HBO's The Brink, but it certainly seems like being Aneesa in Never Have I Ever will be a breakout role for her.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Megan Suri (@megansuri)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She has been acting since she was a kid.</h2><p>Although Megan plays Aneesa expertly in Never Have I Ever, some viewers might still be surprised to know that she started acting at a young age. Growing up primarily in Los Angeles will do that to you. According to Megan's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, she got her first role — in a Honda commercial — at the age of 8.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Megan Suri lived in India for a while before moving to the United States as a kid.</h2><p>In 2020, Megan opened up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Filme Shilmy</a> about living in India for a time and how it helped her relate to her character in The MisEducation of Bindu.</p><p>"I lived in India for two and a half years, and when I came back, I went straight into third grade," she told the outlet. "I just remember certain things that had been indoctrinated in my time of being in school in India, and coming back to the States and then doing those things, and kids just being like, 'What is she doing? She is so weird.'"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Megan Suri (@megansuri)</a></p></figure><p>Megan has fully embraced her role as Aneesa in Never Have I Ever and next up, she'll be in Searching 2.

And now, she has a growing fan base to back that up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwec%2BlmLKrXZa7prHSmmSnnaaav260wK%2BcZqFdmsOmvg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wendy-williams.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wendy Williams Latest News and Updates</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-ryan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lee Ryan - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
