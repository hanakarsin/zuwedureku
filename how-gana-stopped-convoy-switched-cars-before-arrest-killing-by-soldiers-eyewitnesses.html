So, the traditional rulers had to send delegates along with security men to Gbitse to bring him to Katsina-Ala.”</p><p>“Part of the arrangements was to go straight to the residence of Tor Sankera and the paramount ruler of Sankera community, Abu King Shuluwa, but Gana objected to this and asked to be received at Akume Atongo stadium which is a public place.”</p><p>“It was the change in the arrangements that delayed the programme because the initial plan was that Gana and other repentant persons were to be received at the Government House, Makurdi by members of the state security council latest at 1:00pm.”</p><p>The source added that Gana was brought to the stadium at about 12:30pm on Tuesday.</p><p>Another source said he was received at Akume Atongo stadium by traditional rulers, religious leaders, stakeholders and a mammoth crowd, some of whom thronged the stadium to catch a glimpse of him.</p><p>The source added that while the convoy took off from Katsina-Ala at about 1:30pm, Gana was in one of the paramount rulers’ official cars.</p><p>The source said, “But as soon as they crossed River Katsina-Ala Bridge, Gana asked the convoy to stop and told the traditional rulers around him that he was not comfortable with the car he was in. He then asked to be moved to join the car in which a priest was travelling which happened to be the official car of the local government chairman, Alfred Orya Atera.”</p><p>“As he stepped out to enter the car, he looked back at the town and decided to give up his wayward life. He was going to embrace amnesty and if the amnesty was a ploy to kill him to end the crisis, he warned that someone would emerge after him that would be more brutal than him.”</p><p>&nbsp;“All these were spoken in Tiv language. Then he added that he would be more comfortable sitting with the priest in the vehicle and that in case, he died, he wanted to die with Christ. Then, he entered and the convoy zoomed off. Unfortunately, the convoy was intercepted close to Yandev Roundabout in Gboko by soldiers.”</p><p>Gana, who was from a humble background, was alleged to be used by politicians, especially during elections.</p><p>A community leader in the Logo Local Government Area of Benue State, Joseph Anawah, said, “He joined Tiv youths to go into battle against the Kuteb of Taraba State to protect his people. His bravery gave him the pseudonym of Gana. At the time the crisis subsided, Gana formed a militia group and in the cause of looking for a means of survival, he took to criminal activities of robbery and wherever there was a disagreement, squabbles in the community, he and his gang would intervene.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpgZH16e5BrZqGnp2K0orrAZqqtp6ClsqV5wqilr6epYsC4tdOcn56cXZius7%2BMm5yfp6KaeqK%2B0Z6qrWWbnrmttc2gZJuxXai8rbDInqmsZZWusri106ecrKuVqHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./68647-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>See What Mercy Aigbe Says About Her Alleged Romance With Gov.
