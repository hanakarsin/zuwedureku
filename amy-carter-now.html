Why? And where is Amy today? Details ahead.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Amy Carter grew up in front of a nation but where is she now?</h2><p>Carter was the U.S. president from 1977 - 1981, which means that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy</a> was just 9 years old when she moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.</p><p>Before <a href=#>Chelsea Clinton</a>, Barbara and <a href=#>Jenna Bush</a>, and Malia and <a href=#>Sasha Obama</a>, Amy grew up in the public eye.</p><p>She even endured a major scandal during her childhood, as her mom would hire a convicted felon named Mary Prince to be her daughter's White House nanny.</p><p>The decision sparked major controversy despite the fact that the Black woman was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrongfully convicted</a> of the crime. But the former first lady and Prince stayed friends long after Carter left office, with the mom of four defending the exonerated woman at every opportunity.</p><p>Once <a href=#>Ronald Reagan</a> took office, Amy left the White House and went on to political activism in the 1980s. She even got arrested in 1986 for participating in a sit-in in Mass. opposing CIA intervention in Central America, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zinn Education Project</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The former first daughter notably illustrated her father's kids' book, titled The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer.</p><p>She has been married twice, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, first to Gregory Wentzel. In 1999, the couple welcomed a son named <a href=#>Hugo</a>, who would go on to appear on Claim to Fame Season 2.</p><p>But Amy's first marriage didn't last.</p><p>In 2007, she remarried, this time saying "I do" to John Joseph "Jay" Kelly. The couple share another son. The mom of two lives in Atlanta and has not provided any interviews in recent years.</p><p>Indeed, Amy prefers to stay out of the public eye today, and who can blame her, given how she grew up under the microscope? We do know that she sits on the board of The Carter Center.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rosalynn Carter co-founded The Carter Center with her husband.</h2><p>Working to help others who are struggling throughout the world was clearly an inherited trait and a passion that Amy learned from her late mom and her father.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our co-founder, former U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter, passed away this afternoon in Plains, Georgia.</p><p>For more information: <a href=#>https://t.co/82bHoZQvkk</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2exvnQdtab</a></p>— The Carter Center (@CarterCenter) <a href=#>November 19, 2023</a></figure><p>As a non-governmental agency, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Carter Center</a>'s stated goal is "to improve life... by resolving conflicts, advancing democracy and human rights, preventing diseases, and improving mental health care."</p><p>It's not known how much Amy is involved with the organization now, or if her role will change now that her mother has passed away.
