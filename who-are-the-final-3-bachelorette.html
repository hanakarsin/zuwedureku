Hannah B.'s Explosive Showdown With Luke P. on 'The Bachelorette' Revealed</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Gabrielle Bernardini</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated July 2 2019, 3:49 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p><strong>[Warning: Spoilers ahead]</strong> This is the moment <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a> fans have been waiting for all season … and no, it doesn’t involve one guy popping the question to Hannah Brown. Actually, it’s the pageant queen’s explosive fight with contestant Luke P. that has Bachelor Nation going wild! &nbsp;</p><p>ABC has been teasing the heated exchange the past seven episodes, and it’s about to boil over. Hannah gave away her final four roses, meaning we will watch as she is introduced to each of the guys’ families for hometown dates in the next episode. However, Luke’s relationship with Hannah quickly gets flushed down the toilet when he makes an inappropriate comment.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>The controversial contestant has made it known that he wants to keep the “marriage bed” pure and does not want her to be intimate with any of the other men in the house. Well, that’s too bad Luke. The 24-year-old admitted to having sex in a windmill with one of the other guys. “Me f--king in a windmill, you probably wanna leave," she unabashedly said. "I f--ked in a windmill, and guess what? We did it a second time!” she told cameras. Yes, Hannah! With Luke P. out of the race, here are the final three guys who are left on The Bachelorette.&nbsp;</p><p>“Me f--king in a windmill, you probably wanna leave," she unabashedly said.

Now, the reality star is down to her final three guys: Jed Wyatt, Tyler Cameron, and Peter Weber.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>The next person to reportedly be eliminated is 27-year-old Pilot Peter. However, fans have predicted that the Delta Airlines aviator <a href=#>will become the next Bachelor</a>. Let’s face it, he’s handsome, charming, and a freaking pilot! We wouldn’t be surprised if ABC already made the call.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it was initially reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a> that Tyler C. ended up receiving Hannah’s final rose, the blogger said he got his facts wrong and has stated Jed is the ultimate winner. The aspiring singer-songwriter admitted to his beautiful girlfriend that he auditioned for the show to boost his music career, but confessed he fell for her in the process. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><p>However, their fairytale romance may soon be coming to an end. <a href=#>Jed’s alleged girlfriend Haley Stevens</a> recently spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> about her relationship with Jed. She claimed the two were together right before he left for the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“He said, ‘It’s probably not going to happen, but it’s a huge opportunity. I’m only doing this for my music.’ He only did it for his career,” she said. “He told me, 'It’s not real. It’s acting.'”</p><p>Reality Steve dropped a major bombshell when he tweeted that word of Jed’s previous relationship reportedly got back to Hannah and the two ended their engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>"I can confirm that Hannah broke off her engagement to Jed earlier this week. They are still ‘together,’ but the engagement is off,” he tweeted. “This isn't a ‘don't ever talk to me again’ from what I'm being told, but it's also not all rainbows and daffodils either…” Yikes!&nbsp;</p><p>Catch all of the drama unfold on The Bachelorette airing Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecCrnGasmJp6p7XNmqNma12XrqS0xKWmq52kqbI%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1997-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebrities Born in 1997 | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./pacman-jones-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Pacman Jones - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
