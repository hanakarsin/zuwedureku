Although the Drummer Girl Challenge has taken the platform by storm in recent days, it's actually just a rebranding of a challenge that was popular once before. The last time it was popular, it was called the Electrical Tape Challenge. Both challenges have the same features, but one has much more potential for a raunchy ending.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is the Drummer Girl Challenge on TikTok?</h2><p>The Drummer Girl Challenge involves a fairly basic dance routine to the song "Habits" by Tove Lo. The steps feature heartbeats, and the dancers also have to pretend that they're drumming, which is how the challenge got its name. There are a couple of other moves as well, but that's the basic gist of it. Some users also add another twist onto the end of their videos, but that twist is what distinguishes one challenge from the other.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@chickennuggetsop href=#>@chickennuggetsop</a><p>Fsgjsjtdjdtihehehehe</p><a title="♬ Drummer Girl (Contains music from: Habits - Tove Lo) - “Drummer girl”" href=#>♬ Drummer Girl (Contains music from: Habits - Tove Lo) - “Drummer girl”</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>While the Drummer Girl Challenge is fairly tame, the electrical tape challenge can get a little more graphic. It involves doing the same dance moves to the same song, but the Electrical Tape Challenge ends with the dancer lifting their shirt up and flashing the camera. Instead of actually flashing the audience, though, there's electrical tape in the shape of a cross on the person's chest.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Both trends descend from the same idea.</h2><p>The Drummer Girl Challenge and the Electrical Tape Challenge only differ in one detail. Otherwise, they're virtually identical. Thankfully, someone found a way to adapt the Electrical Tape Challenge so that it is a little more PG and kid friendly. After all, TikTok is a platform dominated by young people, many of whom are still under 18. It only makes sense that any viral challenge should be at least somewhat clean.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Claudia Conway has also received attention on TikTok recently.</h2><p>Although <a href=#>TikTok </a>is dominated by young people, the mainstream political press took a greater interest in the platform after Claudia Conway, the daughter of Kellyanne and George Conway, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">began posting</a> about her parents. Initially, Claudia suggested that her mother had been irresponsible in dealing with COVID-19. Kellyanne recently tested positive after a slew of new cases were reported at the White House.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@nokz2525 href=#>@nokz2525</a><p><a title=oops href=#>##oops</a></p><a title="♬ Drummer Girl (Contains music from: Habits - Tove Lo) - “Drummer girl”" href=#>♬ Drummer Girl (Contains music from: Habits - Tove Lo) - “Drummer girl”</a> <span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>With each video that Claudia posts, the attention on her TikTok only grows. Tensions are clearly high in the Conway household, and Claudia has complained in the past about the treatment she's received from her parents. The public interest in the Conways also extends to her parents, who are on opposite sides of the pro-Trump, anti-Trump political divide.&nbsp;</p><p>Kellyanne worked as a senior advisor in the Trump White House for several years. Meanwhile, her husband became one of the chief Republican opponents of President Trump, and even started a Republican foundation dedicated to removing him from the White House. The drama in Claudia's family is intense, and it only seems to be increasing with every video she posts.&nbsp;</p><p>Claudia has yet to participate in the Drummer Girl challenge, but she may still. First, she likely has to get through quarantining with her mother, who recently left her job at the White House.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6kZJ2qpaK6pr6MoKCrpF2YtaK4y56loJ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./handmaids-tale-season-3-spoilers.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>'The Handmaid's Tale' Season 1 Recap Plus Season 3 Spoilers!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uber-eats-additional-57-charge-on-order.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Man Says Uber Eats Charged Him an Additional $57 for Order, Wont Refund Him</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
