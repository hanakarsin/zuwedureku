Igboho is only staying underground for now until when there is breath of fresh air.</p><p>“Nigeria did not show up in court or bring up evidence against Sunday Igboho. So there are no criminal charges against him. When Igboho leaves prison, he’ll demand asylum from other countries including France, and they will be ready to receive him.</p><p>“So he’ll return back to Nigeria when the administration that is against him leaves office.”</p><p>He stated that if Nigeria is not yet secure for Igboho after his release from Benin prison, he would have to transfer all his business activities from Ibadan to Cotonou.</p><p>Falola said: “The judges asked Igboho if he had land in Cotonou and he responded that he has a land in Seme. So, there is still danger ahead. Igboho’s asylum in Cotonou is for him to stay in the country and do his businesses in the country and also travel to Germany to either live there or to travel to and fro. He’ll use Benin as his new home until Buhari’s tenure is over just for his own safety.</p><p>“We should be thankful to the Benin Republic government for granting Igboho access to medical attention. Also, his wife, Ropo goes freely to see him and to also interact with him and bring food regularly.</p><p>“If Igboho had been captured the way Kanu was extradited to Nigeria, then we won’t be talking about him today, his health would have worsened. Look at how his aides have been treated.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FqZqytnpmuunnIoJmooJ9ixLDBy51koZmmmnqjscSnZJ2nn6KypXnIn2ShnV2srrR5wpqnra2imrFuuMiknGamnpa6pbWMpJinrV2dsm7DzqerZqqVqcKzuoyupa2hnGKvtrTAq6BmpJWWw6a%2FjKWYsLGVp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ellah-lakes-lead-losers-chart-as-investors-gain-n71-5bn-at-stock-market.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ellah Lakes Lead Losers' Chart As Investors Gain N71.5bn At Stock Market</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./370278-gej-filfiles-presidential-promise-to-revives-railway-system-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>GEJ Fulfills Presidential Promise, Revives Railway System</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
