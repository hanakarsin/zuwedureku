And the last thing we want to hear is that he abused his power and made his stars — particularly the female talents he honed — uncomfortable behind the scenes.</p><p>But there was a lot of talk regarding why he and Nickelodeon parted ways in 2018 exit and now, with the release of iCarly alum <a href=#>Jennette McCurdy's</a> memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I'm Glad My Mom Died</a>, there is even more reason to believe that Schneider had done wrong.</p><p>Here's everything we know about Dan Schneider's departure from Nickelodeon.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In 2018, Nickelodeon ended its relationship with Dan Schneider.</h2><p>In 2018, Nickelodeon ended its nearly 25-year-long relationship with one of its most esteemed series creators, Dan Schneider, and his production company Schneider's Bakery.</p><p>“Since several Schneider’s Bakery projects are wrapping up, both sides agreed that this is a natural time for Nickelodeon and Schneider’s Bakery to pursue other opportunities and projects," read a statement provided to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> at the time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The statement continued to thank and praise Schneider for his numerous contributions to the network.</p><p>But as Deadline's Nellie Andreeva wrote, "for years Schneider had been under a cloud of suspicion over the treatment of some younger stars of his shows."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>She noted that he previously tweeted now-deleted photos of the toes of his young female stars. Not to mention, there have been complaints regarding exorbitant budgets and long production days under his leadership. She also writes "I hear there had been multiple complaints of abusive behavior against Schneider filed by members of his staff" and nods to him having issues controlling his temper.</p><p>But days after the news was announced that Schneider and Nickelodeon had parted ways, an unnamed source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, that the former Nickelodeon executive actually took a $7 million dollar payout to leave.</p><p>Page Six also spoke of his former habit of posting “seemingly inappropriate videos of his actresses” on social media, including one of Ariana Grande, where she's seen “dousing herself with water" while wearing a revealing number.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>At the time, a source close to Schneider strongly denied to the outlet that he had been inappropriate with his younger stars.
