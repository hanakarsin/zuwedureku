The novelist and nonfiction writer passed away from lung cancer on Oct. 3, 2022. She was only 54. Godfrey was best known for her unique ability to tap into the horror that is being a teenager. In particular, she was drawn to stories of young people committing atrocities because Godfrey was in search of their humanity during those dark times. She believed that we are not what we do.</p><p>Her most gripping work was about a <a href=#>murder that occurred in the small Canadian town</a> where she was from. Under the Bridge was unlike anything anyone had ever seen, and was often compared to <a href=#>Truman Capote's</a> In Cold Blood, in that it opened people up to a previously under-explored world. The world was that of teen girl friendships with a focus on one of the killers, Kelly Ellard. She would eventually be convicted of second-degree murder. Where is she now? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube/CTV Vancouver (video still)</a><p>Kelly Ellard</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Where is Kelly Ellard now?</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Times Colonist</a> as of May 2023, Ellard now goes by the name Kerry Marie Sim and is still in prison where she's been since 2000. The then-40 year-old had gotten her day parole extended another six months which means she could continue leaving the prison during the day for "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">community-based activities</a>," such as employment.</p><p>In 2020 Sim was "allowed to live away from a ­residential facility for up to five days each week," per the outlet, but was quickly overwhelmed by personal issues which included intimate partner violence. When Sim failed to report the abuse, her parole was suspended in August 2021 though it was reinstated two months later. While in prison, Sim gave birth to two children and is the primary caregiver for both of them. She is not allowed to have contact with her ex-husband "without supervision or written consent from her parole officer," the outlet reports.</p><p>Sim is also following a strict mental health plan. This includes regularly seeing a psychologist as well as abstaining from drugs and alcohol. The parole board has been complimentary about Sim's efforts, saying (as summed up by the Times-Colonist) that she is "motivated to live a pro-social life and to become more independent in the community."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What did Kelly Ellard do?</h2><p>Ellard, along with seven other girls and one boy, brutally beat <a href=#>14-year-old Reena Virk</a> in November 1997. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CTV News</a> reported that after Virk had stumbled away, bloody and clearly gravely injured, Ellard and a boy named Warren Glowatski followed. Virk had wandered near the Gorge Waterway where she collapsed. During her hearing, Ellard said she "flicked a lighter" and held it up to Virk's face which is when she saw it was covered in blood.</p><p>Apparently Ellard asked Glowatski to drag Virk closer to the water so she could splash water on the unconscious girl's face. When Virk didn't respond, Ellard said she panicked and pushed her into the water. "I was only thinking of myself," she said. "It's like almost I just thought in my mind, it would just carry the problem away." Later, Glowatski would testify that he saw Ellard drown Virk. Ellard claimed Virk was unresponsive, therefore she "didn't need to hold her head under water."</p><p>Their reasons for killing Virk are rooted in vengeance. The less popular Virk stole a journal that belonged to a friend of Ellard's and proceeded to use the information against her. As punishment for this deed, Ellard and her friends vowed to beat her and took it too far.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKtuNhmnKWkkaexbrrOsA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fccpc-asks-google-apple-stores-to-take-down-illegal-loan-apps.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>FCCPC Asks Google, Apple Stores To Take Down Illegal Loan Apps</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-was-resort-to-love-filmed.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Netflix's Romantic Comedy 'Resort to Love' Was Filmed on an Island Nation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
