She said she endured sexual harassment on set.</h2><p>Back in 2016, Eliza was cast in a recurring role as lawyer J.P. Nunnelly for Season 1 of CBS's new show Bull. It was meant as a regular role, but she ended up being fired. According to Eliza, she was only fired because she accused its star, Michael Weatherly, of sexual harassment.</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a>, a lawsuit stemming from those accusations resulted in Eliza being paid roughly $9.5 million settlement from CBS.</p><p>In the suit, she alleged that Michael made inappropriate comments and gestures toward her, and that at the time when she approached producers about what was going on, she was written off the cast as opposed to the situation being resolved.</p><p>Michael apologized for his actions, per that same New York Times piece, but maintained that he had nothing to do with Eliza being fired: "It’s my recollection that I didn’t tell anyone how they should do their job regarding the hiring or firing of anybody."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Now, Eliza just testified at the House Judiciary Committee about what went down on the 'Bull' set.</h2><p>The latest development in the situation is that Eliza is testifying in front of the House Judiciary Committee in an effort to help put an end to forced arbitration, which she feels her settlement with CBS was. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Appearing virtually</a> in front of the committee, Eliza recalled what happened between her and Michael, although she didn't mention him by name.</p><p>Her hearing was titled "Silenced: How Forced Arbitration Keeps Victims of Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment in the Shadow." In it, Eliza took a firm stance against the legal terms under which she was placed and the financial compensation she felt forced to take to keep quiet after what happened with Michael.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"I’ve worked as an actress since I was a child and signed countless contracts negotiated on my behalf," the actress told the committee. However, she noted a problem, saying that she "never understood that there were mandatory arbitration clauses that would be used to keep what had happened to me a secret and would protect CBS and the sexual harassment perpetrator, who had blatantly retaliated against me for trying the stop the harassment in my workplace."</p><p>CBS's deal with Eliza included a non-disclosure agreement, but she was able to break it due to the committee's subpoena.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmrmqxsBmm66rmKDCbrTUrJmappQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jim-sonefeld-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jim Sonefeld - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./413326-kenyans-ask-guardian-angel-avoid-naysayers-love-older-fiance-fear-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kenyans Ask Guardian Angel to Avoid Naysayers, Love Older Fiance without Fear</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
