Each one has its own special place in my heart and on my TV schedule.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@thebrokeblackgirl</a></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What's your go-to karaoke song?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: ‚ÄúCountry Grammar‚Äù by Nelly ‚Äî no contest! It brings out the St. Louis in me every single time.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What was the first concert you went to?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: My first concert was <a href=#>Ginuwine</a> in the '90s, and it's a memory I cherish deeply. It was an incredible experience that introduced me to the power of live music and the energy from the crowd of fans.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Tell us about the best meal you have ever had.</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: It has to be the homemade hamburger and fries made by my momma. It may sound simple, but it's packed with nostalgia. Every bite takes me back to our old apartment, being a kid without a care in the world, and the pure joy and comforting presence of family.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Today is my momma‚Äôs birthday ü•π<br>She really is THAT girl to me. ü´∂üèæ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y04ZzyDYzE</a></p>‚Äî Dasha | Financial Activist (@brokeblackgirl_) <a href=#>April 27, 2024</a></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Share your top three desert island necessities.</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: It‚Äôs definitely sunscreen, a fire starter, and a trunk filled with books. And, yes, one of those books better be about surviving on a desert island. Gotta stay prepared and entertained.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">Tell us about the best fan interaction you‚Äôve ever had.</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call this a fan interaction, because I consider my audience to be members of my community ‚Äì more like family, really. It all started when a member of my online community and I were working to help another member, but as we talked more, we realized how much we had in common. What began as a few hours on the phone discussing personal finance blossomed into an amazing friendship.</p><p>Fast-forward from 2018, and the unexpected happened. We went from being 600 miles apart to becoming neighbors and, together, we‚Äôve made major changes in our personal and professional lives! It‚Äôs fascinating how a bond formed in a Facebook group can lead to such a significant life change and friendship.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What is the best financial advice you‚Äôve ever received?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: The best financial advice‚Äî or maybe it was more of a warning ‚Äî was, ‚ÄúStop pocket-watching other people." It's something my grandma used to say; it has stuck with me. At first, I didn‚Äôt know if it was meant as advice or a gentle nudge to mind my own business, but since then, it's been golden.</p><p>This piece of wisdom has helped me concentrate on my own financial journey and has kept me away from the weight of societal expectations about money. By focusing on my own pocket, I‚Äôve been able to make choices that suit me and my goals, move at my own pace, and not get caught up in what everyone else is doing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Dasha | Financial Activist (@thebrokeblackgirl)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What is a guilty pleasure you don't feel bad spending money on?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: Without a doubt, I don‚Äôt mind paying for subscriptions to streaming services to avoid ads. As a self-proclaimed film and TV enthusiast, interruptions are my nemesis. The ability to watch a story unfold without the abrupt stop for ads? Priceless. Sign me up! Life's too short for commercials!</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What is your favorite money/budget trend you have seen on social media?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: My favorite trend I‚Äôve seen are <a href=#>savings challenges,</a> hands down. They're a fun and engaging way to build a saving habit. What I love about savings challenges is how they turn the task of saving money into a community-driven [project] where almost anyone can participate, especially in the penny and dollar challenges.</p><p>Social media users share their progress and tips to save, and even develop healthy competition with each other, making the act of saving feel less like a chore and more like a shared journey. It‚Äôs a powerful way to visualize how small, consistent efforts can lead to substantial results ‚Äî creating a sense of accomplishment and financial responsibility.</p><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What is your hot take when it comes to personal finance?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: You know, I really lean into the idea of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">prioritizing financial flexibility</a> over just chasing financial freedom. Here's the thing ‚Äî life's thrown us curveballs, especially these past five years. Even the best-laid plans aren't immune to life's surprises. So being able to adapt financially means not being stuck on just one version of success or freedom.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by National Debt Relief (@nationaldebtrelief)</a></p></figure><h2 class="sc-kBqltT kXTuqB">What is your No. 1 distraction?</h2><p><strong>DK</strong>: My son is at the forefront of my mind these days. As a proud mom watching her 15-year-old excel academically and athletically, I can't help but think about the next big step in his life: college. It's more than just pride; it's a bittersweet realization that he's growing up and about to go on a personal journey.</p><p>I find myself constantly thinking about whether we've had enough conversations about the important stuff ‚Äî life skills, managing finances, handling stress, and staying true to himself in a world that's always trying to push people in different directions.</p><p>It's a mix of excitement for what's ahead for him and a maternal instinct to make sure he's as prepared as can be for whatever comes his way. So, I guess you could say my distraction is also my motivation: making sure my son steps into the future ready for anything.</p><p>To learn more about the Financial Wellness Board, visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmba0wNGamq2dlGLEqsDHZpuaq5iWeqyxzaecnbE%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Famous Jameses | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-plays-nancy-on-ghosts.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Who's the Hilarious Actress Who Plays Nancy on 'Ghosts'?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
