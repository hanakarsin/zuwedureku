Thanks to Kim's sex tape with R&B singer Ray J that was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purportedly leaked/pushed by her own mother</a>, the Kardashian name became synonymous with scandal. Since then they've had a wildly successful reality TV series, launched several businesses, and have dominated the social media landscape in the process while dating a number of high-profile athletes, artists, and celebrities.</p><p>In their new Hulu reality show, The Kardashians, Kim talks about her SNL debut, and a joke that didn't make the opening monologue.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was the joke struck from Kim's SNL monologue?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> showed a clip from the family's new reality series on Hulu, which aired on April 21, 2022, where comedian Amy Schumer sits down with Kim to talk about her SNL hosting stint.</p><p>Comedian Michelle Wolf penned a bunch of jokes for Kim to rattle off during the monologue, however, many didn't make it to air.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span></figure><p>Kim was running a few jokes by Amy before going on SNL, and the joke in question that was cut was one that referenced her sister Khloe and ex Tristan Thompson. "Oh Khloe, you have the biggest heart, it's so big it has room for Tristan and all of his side pieces. And Kris, Kris you're not one of my sisters it's not a joke I just thought I'd remind you."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube | Entertainment Tonight</span></figure><p>Schumer would go on to not respond well to many of the jokes, which then sent Kim into a fit on uncertainty going into the monologue. Schumer has been accused of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stealing jokes from other comedians</a> and passing them off as her own on several occasions, something that many have brought up on social media in response to Amy's lackluster response to the zingers Kim rattled off.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Also can we discuss how everything Kim said was genuinely funny and Amy Schumer told her to not say any of those jokes?????!!!

However, whatever she earned for the gig is a drop in a bucket compared to her reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1.8 Billion Net Worth</a>. Justin Timberlake said that he was paid a minimum of $5,000 to host SNL, something that he calls the "best" $5,000 anyone can make on television.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Pay for hosts varies from talent, to talent however. Some folks have reportedly earned $25,000 to host an episode of the show, which is about a week's worth of work. Which isn't too shabby. But for the NBC program, it's mostly about the experience for entertainers to work a live TV broadcast and see the inner workings of how the series is made.</p><p>Plus, the opportunity to work with a bunch of talented comedians and "proving" to yourself that you're up to the challenge of working in such an energized, high stress environment is pretty darn cool, too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLauecqaqZ2Zo522orqMpqanp5yktLaxjKylpQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1178300-best-nollywood-movies-time-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Best Nollywood movies of all time</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cruel-summer-ending-spoilers.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kate and Jeanette Face off in Court During the 'Cruel Summer' Season 1 Finale (SPOILERS)</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
