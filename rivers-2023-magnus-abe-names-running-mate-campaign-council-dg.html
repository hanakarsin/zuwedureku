First of all, what were we looking for? We were looking for somebody who will add value to the ticket; somebody who can be governor if I am not there.</p><p>“Somebody who can lead the state in the direction we want the state to go. Somebody who has knowledge and can advise and contribute to the kind of Rivers State we will all like to see.</p><p>“We wanted somebody who will be an asset. We were not necessarily looking for a woman, but with a clear target of what we wanted in mind, we now got to the business of trying to identify who that person should be.”</p><p>According to him, the&nbsp;choice of Senator Ake as Director-General of the Campaign Council was based on the fact that he is approachable and can approach anyone.</p><p>He said: “I want to thank all of you for your support and patience. I stand here today to introduce to you the Director-General of our campaign council.</p><p>“We wanted someone who is known to Rivers people, somebody who is approachable and can approach people, somebody who can contribute resources to our project.</p><p>“We are here to introduce and unveil the Director-General of our Campaign Council, the real Distinguished Senator Wilson Asinobi Ake.</p><p>“When people have given you responsibility to lead, take decisions on their behalf and they will support you. Today, I am a candidate for governor of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and we are talking about Campaign Council that will help us as a team to win election in this state.</p><p>“I am the leader of that team; I am the governorship candidate. No matter who I ask, the ultimate responsibility for taking decisions on our behalf will be mine. Have confidence in me as your candidate, I will continue to take decisions in your best interest.”</p><h2>Oldest Political Party</h2><p>Also speaking at the ceremony, the SDP National Chairman, Shehu Gaban, stated that the SDP is the second oldest existing political party in Nigeria after the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP).</p><p>Gaban, who was represented by the Vice Chairman, South-South, <strong>Frederick Alaowei Owoforufa</strong>, called on the party in the state to work together to ensure victory in 2023.</p><p>He said: “The mammoth crowd we are seeing here today should translate to votes on the day of the election. Crowd without the votes does not give us the chance that we require.</p><p>“The National Chairman expects us to stand firmly by the train that is being driven by His Excellency, Senator Magnus Abe. We have to work together as one family; we have to work together as one team. The team that people at the other side will not be able to break in.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FuZquhppq%2FtHmRaWlsZZ2WtK%2FB0maYm51do66usdJmqa6mnp67qHnMmqueZZOWurGtyKClZpufqruktctmm6Bn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./why-is-sofi-stadium-so-expensive.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The SoFi Stadium Is Nice, but Is It $5 Billion Nice?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1258680-how-play-merrybet-registration-login-mobile-computer-version-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How to play Merrybet: registration, login, mobile vs. computer version</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
