The series features fan favorites like Amber Portwood, Ashley Jones, Cheyenne Floyd, and <a href=#>Jade Cline</a>. On the April 9 episode of the hit reality show, Jade got a surprise visit from her best friend, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chau</a>, and now fans are curious about the pair’s friendship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jade made her television debut in 2018 when she appeared on <a href=#>Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant</a>. At just 17 years old, Jade gave birth to her daughter Kloie, who she shares with Sean Austin. The couple, who got engaged in 2022, have experienced their fair share of relationship drama. Sean previously struggled with drug addiction, as his troubles were heavily documented in Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant. While Jade struggled to maintain her mental health.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Despite their on-again, off-again relationship, the couple recently committed to making things work. In a December 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!

However, Jade’s relationship with Sean is not the only pairing that fans are curious about. Some want to know more about Jade’s BFF, Chau, who has now joined the fold.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Jade’s friend, Chau?</h2><p>On a previous <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">episode</a> of Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, Jade’s friend Chau surprised her at work making for a sweet reunion. Sean coordinated the surprise, which left the Teen Mom star in tears. “I was hoping you would come to visit and surprise Jade. I think it'd be really good for her. She needs a little release,” Sean said. Jade went on to call her friend her “soulmate,” explaining to Sean that the two pals have a “different type of love.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Jade and Chau have been friends for years. Chau also appeared in Teen Mom: Family Reunion, where she was asked to be Kloie’s godmother. “You’re like a piece of my family,” Jade told Chau before presenting her with a gift (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsters & Critics</a>). “And I feel like my life wouldn’t be the same without you.” Without hesitation Chau accepted Jade’s offer, promising to care for Kloie in the event Jade and Sean aren't able to.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long have Jade and Chau been friends?</h2><p>Jade and Chau have a very strong bond.
