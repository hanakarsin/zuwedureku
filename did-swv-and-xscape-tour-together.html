The limited series gives us the behind-the-scenes moments between the top-charting girl groups that we were never privy to before reality TV.</p><p>On the show, the group discussed their plans for a joint tour. However, they needed help to agree on many facets of the tour, including which dynamic group would headline the future shows. Since filming together, did Xscape and SWV <a href=#>come to an understanding</a>? Here’s the status of the SWV and Xscape tour.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did SWV and Xscape tour together?</h2><p>SWV & Xscape: Queens of R&B began filming in the Summer of 2022. Both groups booked individual projects and performances during that time but have yet to announce a joint tour. In 2023, the bands have continued staying <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">booked and busy</a>, though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">none of the listed dates</a> for SWV nor Xscape show any tour stops with the singers in the same place simultaneously.</p><p>Xscape and SWV haven’t shared if they will try to go on tour after their reality show wraps. On the show, fans watched the tensions rise between the music vets in Season 1, Episode 3, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dis-Chord.</a>”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span></figure><p>While discussing the tour as a unit, SWV, and Xscape debated whether they should have a headliner for the show or if they should co-headline the concerts. SWV believed the groups should co-headline the tour and rotate their hits throughout the night, but Xscape had other plans. The “Who Can I Run To?” singers told SWV they would prefer if they opened for them and listed them as the tour’s headliner.</p><p>SWV didn’t take the suggestion well, considering they came out several years before Xscape and <a href=#>have sold more records</a> than their younger counterparts, which <a href=#>Coko Clemons</a> reminded them of on the show.</p><p>“I sold 30 million records, b—h,” Coko said during their groups’ discussion.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kandi Burruss said SWV opened for her group long before ‘SWV & Xscape: Queens of R&B.’</h2><p>A social media war exploded after SWV & Xscape’s March 2023 episode. Several fans disagreed with Xscape’s decision not to co-headline with SWV, noting that Xscape’s internal issues already exed them out of the headliner spot.</p><p>During filming, Xscape members <a href=#>LaTocha Scott and Tamika Scott</a> were beefing after Tocha and her husband, <a href=#>Rocky Bivens</a>, allegedly stole money from her sister, Tamika. The chaos spilled over to Xscape’s ongoing issues that led to their 1998 breakup.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Xscape don’t even know whether they have 3, 4 or 5 members but THEY want to headline a show over SWV?!

Kandi also said SWV’s anger about Xscape’s plans to headline the tour wasn’t warranted, especially since they’ve opened for Xscape before.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Don Juan posting where swv was under xscape , was the great xscape tour … this is a joint show not just xscape show that makes it a big difference … Also to question swv 30 mill sold was an insult ..they actually sold over 30 mill now ..<a href=#>#SWVAndEscape</a></p>— Jersey’s Best (@Rahsofly1) <a href=#>March 17, 2023</a></figure><p>On Speak On It, <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Atlanta star</a> screenshotted a post from her BFF <a href=#>DonJuan Clark</a>’s account. The screenshot was a flyer from Xscape’s 2018 tour, “The Great Xscape Tour,” with Xscape as the headliner and SWV and <a href=#>Bell Biv Devoe</a> listed as “special guests.” Kandi shared a video of her and SWV prepping for the tour backstage to make the tea even hotter.</p><p>Kandi added that SWV had performed before Xscape on numerous festivals since Xscape reunited in 2017. Although Kandi’s receipts are telling, SWV still hasn’t agreed to be Xscape’s opening act.</p><p>Catch new episodes of SWV & Xscape: Queens of R&B Sundays at 8 p.m. EST on Bravo and streaming on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledKwrWaZnpl6ub%2FCmqeeZaSkwrN506ienqyYmr8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./election-petitions-wasted-tinubus-first-seven-months-pdp-spokesman.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Election Petitions Wasted Tinubus First Seven Months PDP Spokesman</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1521778-singer-tiwa-savage-rocks-n75m-birkin-bag-photos-flaunts-skin-cutout-pants-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Singer Tiwa Savage Rocks N7.5m Birkin Bag in New Photos as She Flaunts Skin in Cutout Pants</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
