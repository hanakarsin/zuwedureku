That makes citizens wonder if the government is doing enough. However, it is not only up to the government to deal with the problem since in the end it affects everyone. Each person must dedicate themselves to helping the country fight the pandemic. To do that you need to be informed. This article will talk about the various causes of drought in Kenya 2017, the effects it has had on the people and what can be done to fight it.</p><h2>Causes of drought in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>Understanding why we constantly have drought in Kenya is the first step in realizing the answers to our questions. Here are some of the most common causes for drought in the country.</p><h3>1. Inadequate rainfall</h3><p class=align-left>Many areas around the country receive very little to no rainfall at all in the year and that is why they have drought. Such areas go for very long periods of time without rainfall which leads to them becoming very dry. The rivers, lakes and dams in these areas dry out, which also means that water does not evaporate into the atmosphere to form clouds for rain.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/91eb86fc22cebbe4.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Famous South African proverbs and sayings</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Such areas, due to inadequate rainfall end up having no agricultural development since there are also no water bodies to facilitate irrigation. Such an area is considered agriculturally drought and will often require food aid as seen in past years in Northern Kenya.</p><h3>3. Deforestation</h3><p class=align-left>For the longest time Kenyans have been warned about cutting down trees but this has gone unheard. People do not understand that without trees there would not be any rain which means no farming hence drought and famine.</p><p class=align-left>Cutting down trees for fuel, firewood or charcoal, is one of the biggest reasons why there is no rain in many parts of the country. This continues even after the government has made other sources of energy such as gas more affordable. New measures have been put in place to arrest those caught illegally cutting down trees but it all seems too little.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/33579f468953d79e.jpeg><h3>4. Global warming</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5704a717c57c6a7e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about the new Kenyan currency</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Over the last decade, the temperatures on earth have raised leading to severe effects on most parts of the world. Due to <a id=https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/ href=# title="causes of global warming" rel="nofollow noopener">warmer temperatures</a>, the world has more greenhouse gasses that trap the heat from escaping the earth. With time, this makes it generally warmer hence causing drought.</p><p class=align-left>Due to the high temperatures, the moisture from the earth evaporates causing the soil to dry out. Water too from masses of water evaporates which leads to drier areas in places that were relatively wet. Also due to higher temperatures in the country, the need for water increases so people end up drying out dams and lakes which do not get replenished due to inadequate rainfall.</p><h3>5. Land encroachment</h3><p class=align-left>Due to growth in population on most areas of the country, people have encroached on wet areas and forests to create space for living. This leads to drying out of the water bodies or wetlands as people bring in concrete and other solid construction material that isn't so good at conserving wetlands.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/396f5b6f6d684725.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Causes of climate change in Kenya and the world</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The forests cover in the country is reducing day by day since people insist on living in the forested areas. As a result, deforestation occurs and since there is reduced rainfall in these areas, drought encroaches on the land and quickly spreads.</p><h3>6. Overpopulation</h3><p class=align-left>There is a need to regulate population growth in the country since it has led to overuse of many resources that affect the climate of the country. There is more need for water now more than at any other time before which means that more rivers, dams and even lakes are being drained out rapidly. However, since a lot of the areas are already affected by drought, these sources of water do not recover in time hence leading to drought.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, there is inadequate water that is needed for agriculture which threatens the food security of the country hence causing famine in many parts.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1ovvudkcejoo.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>There are beautiful Kenyan house plans photos one can choose from when building there home</span></p></a><h2>Effects of drought</h2><p class=align-left>When an area is completely dry, there is not much development that goes on there including economic and social. The drought affected areas end up having a lot of different effects on crops, people and animals since water is required by every living being so as to survive. The effects of drought are categorized into environmental, social and economic. The following are some of the impacts of drought in Kenya:</p><h2>Environmental effects</h2><p class=align-left>The first area that is affected by drought is the environment and everything that exists there. Since water is needed for things to live, lack of it means that very little can survive out there. Every single aspect of the environment including the non-living is very much affected by prolonged drought. Here are some of those aspects and the effects on them.</p><h3>1. Drying up of water bodies</h3><p class=align-left>Due to lack of rain and the high temperatures that are there in places affected by drought, water masses such as lakes, rivers, dams and boreholes eventually dry up. This often leads to a shortage of water for animals and human beings who have to go long distances in search of water. Crops in the fields too die because they cannot survive without water hence people are unable to produce crops to sustain themselves and their livestock.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs5fdj5o6lhm3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Poverty in Kenya: facts and causes</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/91eb86fc22cebbe4.jpeg><h3>2. Poor soil quality</h3><p class=align-left>For soil to be fertile and able to sustain plants, it needs to have a certain content of water otherwise it will be useless. Due to drought and prolonged periods of time without the soil getting any water in it, it loses the quality hence even after it is watered, it may not grow any plants. There is also reduced organic material content in the soil making it even more unfavorable to farming.</p><h3>3. Death of animals</h3><p class=align-left>Due to lack of water, many animals end up having to migrate so as to look for the important commodity. In other cases, both domestic and wild animals end up dying since they can only live for a limited period of time without water. Many animals die on the way to the few watering holes while others are unable to live very long even after finding it due to hunger and fatigue caused by travelling long distances in the heat.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhssrrats4k318.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to Join Illuminati in Kenya and Get Rich</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Tullow Oil threatens to shut down Turkana operations amidst standoff with locals</strong></p><h3>4. Death of plants</h3><p class=align-left>Due to the poor quality soil and low moisture or nutrients, the majority of the plants unable to reach the water deep in the ground die. Crops in the farms are usually the first to die even the ones that benefited from irrigation after the sources of water go dry. Trees and other vegetation are next which means that there will be no food for domestic and herbivore wild animals. The ecosystem is completely disrupted as everything dies or migrates.</p><h2>Social effects of drought in Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>These are the reparcussions that directly affect the way of life of people. The following are some of the major ones:</p><h3>1. Hunger, malnutrition and death</h3><p class=align-left>This is one of the biggest problems found in areas affected by drought. Since there are no sources of water and no plants growing, people end up spending days hungry or with very little to eat. As a result, many children end up malnourished with various diseases and they eventually die. Some people result in eating the few wild fruit that grow in the dry region that often ends up poisoning them leading to death.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1rlrfooqa30o.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Banana Farming in Kenya: Make Money Growing Ndizi</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They often have to depend only on relief food which is usually not balanced, so malnutrition still remains a big problem. The drought causes a lot of suffering among the people and by the end of the period, hundreds of people are deceased.</p><h3>2. Proliferation of waterborne diseases</h3><p class=align-left>For those people who are lucky enough to find water, they often consume unclean and untreated water that causes various waterborne diseases. There is usually no opportunity to boil the water given that many of them travel many kilometers just to find the little water so they drink it straight from the source.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs250dgetplkig.jpeg><p class=align-left>Due to drought, there is a higher concentration of bacteria and various chemicals that may find their way into the water. As a result, the water is not safe for drinking without undergoing treatment, but this usually doesn’t happen. Drinking the unclean water hence results in various diseases such as cholera and typhoid among other complications that often lead to death.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs6dnlp94gpnv.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Main Causes of Unemployment in Kenya: Solutions to the National Problem</span></p></a><h3>3. Animal and human migration</h3><p class=align-left>Many of the people leaving in areas affected by drought are pastoralists but due to the climatic conditions, they end up migrating a lot more and hardly ever get back to their homes. This causes families to separate and there is desperation when children grow up without part of their families.</p><p class=align-left>Because of all the migration, children also do not get a good shot at education since they have to move to look for pasture and water for animals and themselves. This causes disorientation of children and they are unable to progress beyond the situation that they find themselves in. other affected parties are women and the elderly who are left in homes forced to fend for themselves and their young children. That also causes stress and anxiety and an overall unhealthy psychological state.</p><h2>Economic effects</h2><p class=align-left>These are the losses that people suffer in terms of money since they are unable to make a living and they suffer huge losses in what they had for both the communities around these areas and the government as a whole. Some of them include:</p><h3>1. Reduced to no yield of crops</h3><p class=align-left>Farmers in areas affected by drought suffer some of the biggest loses especially if they had not planted drought resistant crops. This is a disappointment to farmers who use a lot of money and other resources in planting their crops only to end up with losses. Some may completely lose everything they worked so hard for while the luckier ones who perhaps<a id=https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2017/03/14/makueni-farmers-abandon-maize-for-drought-resistant-crops_c1523215 href=# title="drought resistant crops" rel="nofollow noopener"> grew drought resistant crops</a> end up with very little from their farms.</p><h3>3. Loss of livestock</h3><p class=align-left>For those who depend on their livestock as a source of living, drought leads to the death of most of them due to lack of food and water. They are unable to get the milk that they used to get before to sell and earn a living. On the other hand, those that sold their animals for meat can’t do so since they suffer from starvation which causes them to be very thin. In the end due to their own starvation, they end up slaughtering their livestock so they can feed their families.</p><h3>4. Collapse of businesses</h3><p class=align-left>Areas which were once very vibrant with many businesses end up chasing away any investors due to drought. If there were farmers in the area buying farm supplies from the local factories and stores, they are unable to do so due to poor yields and income. As a result, these businesses are forced to close down, leading to unemployment of more people.</p><h3>5. Higher cost of hydro-energy</h3><p class=align-left>The country is highly reliant on hydro- energy and when drought strikes, the dams end up not having adequate water to produce power. This often leads to power rationing and increased bills that affect a lot of the households and businesses in the country.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Meru County is using mobile phones to fight hunger and this is how farmers are doing it</strong></p><p class=align-left>Some businesses are forced to use generators that are powered by fuel which is very expensive in the country. As a result, they end up having much higher cost of operation which is not sustainable and some of them end up having to close down. The overall cost of operating a business becomes too high and energy companies end up making a lot of losses which has increased the rate of inflation over time.</p><h3>6. Government losses</h3><p class=align-left>If businesses shut down, it means that the government can’t collect taxes from them hence it won't have all the revenue it needs for full out development. Instead, it is forced to use a lot of resources and direct them to these areas in providing farmers with the means to grow crops. They have to dig boreholes and construct dams so as to facilitate agriculture. Sometimes this doesn’t work out when the drought persists which leads to losses.</p><p class=align-left>They also have to dig into the country’s food basket so as to feed the people without getting more crops that will allow it to replenish what was used up.</p><h2>Solutions to combat drought in the country</h2><p class=align-left>Now that you know what causes drought and the effects that it has on the country, it is important to know what is being and can be done to rectify the situation. Some of the solutions highly rely on the help of the government but there is a lot that you can do so as to reduce the effects of this climate change on people. Here are some possible solutions to ending drought emergencies in Kenya:</p><h3>1. Planting trees</h3><p class=align-left>So as to combat drought in the long run, it is important that the country increases its forest cover so as to get more rain. This is one of the solutions that take time but starting early means that the future generations will not have to go through the same problem that exists now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5704a717c57c6a7e.jpeg><p class=align-left>The government has been encouraging more people to plant trees and although a lot of trees have already been planted, there is still more to be done. Refrain from cutting down trees for burning charcoal as that will affect the little hope the country has for more forest cover.</p><h3>2. Make pastoralism a sustainable economic activity</h3><p class=align-left>The larger population in northern Kenya where drought is rapid consists of pastoralists that rely on their livestock for livelihood. The best thing that can be done is to make it sustainable by ensuring that the animals have adequate water and pasture so as to reduce migration.</p><p class=align-left>The government in collaboration with the county governments can establish beef production factories so as to enable the people sell their livestock so as to earn a living. They ensure that the prices for buying the livestock are favorable to enable them to grow their herds and as a result take care of their families.</p><h3>3. Irrigation for farmers</h3><p class=align-left>For farmers in these areas to be able to produce enough food for the people in the region, they need to have a way they can grow their crops. The only way this is possible is through irrigation which is already there but a lot more can be done.</p><p class=align-left>The government needs to sink more boreholes and construct more dams so as to provide sufficient water that will sustain different crops. More research also needs to be done into introducing drought resistant crops to the farmers. This ensures that they have a productive economic activity that they can rely on and that will contribute to the economic growth of the area.</p><h3>4. Hunger Safety Net program</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# title="hunger safety net program" rel="nofollow noopener">Hunger Safety Net program</a> was started to enable those areas that were heavily affected by drought to gain access to food and cash for economic and social sustenance. It targeted the poorest and the neediest of all of them so that they are able to get cash transfers so that they may help themselves.</p><p class=align-left>The programme only targeted the worst affected but it wasn’t able to reach all of them so more resources need to be put in so as to improve it. It should be able to reach most of the people affected by the drought such that they receive the cash transfers and food aid much easily from their county governments.</p><h3>5. Providing safe drinking water to drought infected areas</h3><p class=align-left>In order to reduce the number of people dying due to consuming water that isn’t safe for drinking, there should be provision of treated water at all water points. The government can do this by providing water filters at these stations so that the residents can access ready to drink water for their households.</p><p class=align-left>The county government can also ensure that they carry out maintenance checks for all sources of water to make sure that they are not dirty or contaminated by chemicals. By doing this, water borne diseases such as cholera will be a thing of the past hence reducing the mortality rate.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: Uhuru honours ex Citizen TV queen's wish, sets day for National Tree planting</strong></p><h3>6. Food conservation</h3><p class=align-left>Once the areas are already harvesting a lot from the irrigated farms, they need to be taught about food conservation for those very dry months. The national food basket should only come in when the situation is very dire since they are able to feed themselves from the food that they stored away during the productive months.</p><p class=align-left>That is why they need to be taught more on planting non-perishable foods such as millet, sorghum, maize and beans which can be stored for months. The same should be done for animals by creating hay and silage such that the country establishes sufficient hay stores so that when there is drought there is adequate hay for the animals. That will prevent any animals from dying which leads to economic losses for the pastoralists.</p><p class=align-left>The issue about drought and how to overcome it in the country is one that cannot be solves in one day or even a couple of months. It is a continuous battle that every citizen needs to put an effort in fighting. Ensure that you do even the least you can in ensuring that drought is no longer a pandemic like it has been in the previous years. The little you do even if it is planting a single tree will have a huge impact in the future that we will have as a country.
