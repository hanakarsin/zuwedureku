I started writing it, and then I thought, 'No, let them dig around when I'm dead.'"</p><p>That's what trailblazing guitarist <a href=#>Jeff Beck</a> once said about his own memoir. Sadly, that book might be <a href=#>closer to being written</a> as it was recently announced the innovative musician suddenly passed away at age 78. Here's what we know about Jeff Beck's cause of death.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeff Beck's cause of death was revealed.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Jeff's family confirmed that he died on Wednesday, Jan. 11.</p><p>"On behalf of his family, it is with deep and profound sadness that we share the news of Jeff Beck’s passing," they said in a statement. "After suddenly contracting bacterial <a href=#>meningitis</a>, he peacefully passed away yesterday. His family asks for privacy while they process this tremendous loss."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>(L-R) Jim McCarty, Chris Dreja, Paul Samwell-Smith, Keith Relf, and Jeff Beck of The Yardbirds</p></figure><p>Fans and fellow musicians took to social media to mourn the loss of a man whose talent and drive were unparalleled.</p><p>"I can’t express how saddened I am to hear of Jeff Beck's passing," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted Ozzy Osborne</a>. "What a terrible loss for his family, friends, and his many fans. It was such an honor to have known Jeff and an incredible honor to have had him play on my most recent album, Patient Number 9. Long live Jeff Beck."</p><p>Led Zeppelin guitarist <a href=#>Jimmy Page</a> also expressed his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">remorse in a tweet</a>: "His technique unique. His imaginations apparently limitless. Jeff, I will miss you along with your millions of fans. Jeff Beck Rest in Peace."</p><p>The list of incredible artists chiming in just keeps going. From KISS's Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons to former MTV VJ Martha Quinn, it's clear that Jeff's time on this earth left an indelible mark.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeff Beck was No. 5 on Rolling Stone's '100 Greatest Guitarists' list.</h2><p>In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone's</a> description of Jeff Beck, Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers heaped praise upon praise regarding his musical prowess. You don't get to sit snugly in spot No. 5 by running with lemmings. Mike wrote, "Even in the <a href=#>Yardbirds</a>, he had a tone that was melodic but in-your-face — bright, urgent and edgy, but sweet at the same time. You could tell he was a serious player, and he was going for it. He was not holding back."</p><p>Not holding back is what earned Jeff Beck eight Grammys and two inductions into the <a href=#>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, "both as a member of the Yardbirds as well as for his work with his own Jeff Beck Group," per Rolling Stone. While his stint with the Yardbirds lasted only 20 months, it was during that time they released their best music.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>When he quit the Yardbirds due to conflicting personalities and illness on Jeff's part, he founded the Jeff Beck Group. Along with <a href=#>Rod Stewart</a> and Ron Wood, they put out two albums and "turned down an appearance at Woodstock before Beck disbanded the ensemble, leaving Stewart and Wood to join Faces."</p><p>In the 1980s, Jeff spent most of his time as a hired gun working with people like Tina Turner, Mick Jagger, and Jon Bon Jovi, but he just couldn't find his way back to himself.</p><p>Although his solo career never took off, Jeff Beck left his mark as a prolific guitarist paving the way for generations of musicians to come. He is frequently name checked as one of the best guitar players to ever grace any stage or studio. His legacy and his gifts will undoubtedly live on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7KnsoybnJyjXZiutr%2FEZqafZZSarrW0</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./301213-beautiful-african-names-baby-boy-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beautiful African names for baby boy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jalen-mcmillan-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jalen McMillan - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
