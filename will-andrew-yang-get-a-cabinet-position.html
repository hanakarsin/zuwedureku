Joe Biden obviously won the ticket ‚Äî and the presidency ‚Äî but Yang supporters haven't forgotten their guy. And plenty have wondered: Will Andrew Yang get a cabinet position?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Andrew Yang get a cabinet position?</h2><p>So far, President-elect Joe Biden hasn't nominated Andrew Yang to a cabinet position. There's still plenty of time for that to happen, of course, if Biden does have a job in mind for him. But if he doesn't, then there could be for a valid reason according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Politico</a>.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not putting together a team of rivals, he‚Äôs putting together a team.

He‚Äôs not interested in conflict as much as he wants to have people who have done the job before and they can all work together to get all the work done."</p><p>Marsh explained that a lack of other 2020 presidential contenders in Biden's cabinet ‚Äî including Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Beto O'Rourke and Andrew Yang &nbsp;‚Äî will help further establish Harris as the default 2024 Democratic frontrunner.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Then again, Joe Biden nominated Pete Buttigieg to a cabinet position.</h2><p>Anything could happen, after all, right?

It isn't clear whether that's the plan. However, Yang has said that he's open to another presidential run in the future.</p><p>‚ÄúWe all know if I ran again, it would be a lot more fun than the first time," Yang told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Finance Live</a> on Nov. 10. "Because the first time, you know, I was kind of climbing out of anonymity. The second time, you know, we'd have a blast from day one.
