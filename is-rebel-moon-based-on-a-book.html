Though he's been responsible for well-remembered film moments in films like 300, his work on the now-defunct <a href=#>DC Extended Universe</a> of films was polarizing, to say the least. While many critics and fans decried his work with adapting DC heroes, others have proven just as fervent in defending his vision and claiming him as a director with a unique artistic vision.</p><p>However, even his non-comic related work hasn't exactly won people over. The latest example comes in the form of Rebel Moon, a new film series by Snyder.</p><p>The first film, A Child of Fire, was released on <a href=#>Netflix</a> (following a limited theatrical release) on Dec. 21 to mixed reviews from critics. Still, the moderate buzz surrounding the film has led people to ask whether or not the films are based on books. Here's what you should know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In rare form, the 'Rebel Moon' films are completely original.</h2><p>The Rebel Moon film series is set in a far-off galaxy ruled by the motherworld and its oppressive militaristic might led by the Imperium. In A Child of Fire, Kora (<a href=#>Sofia Boutella</a>) fights against her former Imperium comrades in order to put an end to their reign.</p><p>The second film in the series, The Scargiver, is already slated for release in 2024.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Titles like "A Child of Fire" and "The Scargiver" certainly sound like titles that you might glance at on a shelf in the <a href=#>YA Novel</a> section of a bookstore. However, you might be surprised to know that the Rebel Moon story is completely original.</p><p>The screenplays for both films were co-written by Snyder himself, Atomic Blonde writer Kurt Johnstad, and Shay Hatten who previously worked on two <a href=#>John Wick</a> films.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bleeding Cool</a>, Zack Snyder even revealed that he'd first come up with the concept when he was 12 years old. The film series also reportedly draws inspiration from the likes of <a href=#>Star Wars</a> and Akira Kurosawa movies.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This wouldn't be the first time that Zack Snyder came up with his own original screenplay for a film. In 2011, he co-wrote Sucker Punch alongside screenwriter Steve Shibuya.</p><p>But just as his name has never been a seal of quality for his DC film adaptations, the same rings true for his original works. Like Rebel Moon after it, Sucker Punch also received poor reviews from critics upon release.</p><p>For better or worse, Rebel Moon is a completely original work, one whose story will soon continue. Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver is set to release on Netflix on April 19, 2024.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvsSbnKVlnaS8r3nBmqqenF2ku26tjJumqKM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./414445-shantel-nzembi-maafisa-wa-dci-wamkamata-mshukiwa-mkuu-wa-mauaji-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shantel Nzembi: Maafisa wa DCI Wamkamata mshukiwa Mkuu wa Mauaji</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./1089959-efcc-recovers-17-vehicles-comptroller-general-customs-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>EFCC recovers 17 vehicles from ex-Comptroller General of Customs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
