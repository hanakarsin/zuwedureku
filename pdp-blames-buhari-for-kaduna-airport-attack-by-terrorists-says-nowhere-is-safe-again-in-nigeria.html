Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in its reaction to Saturday’s attack by bandit terrorists on Kaduna Airport has blamed it on the inefficiency of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government.</h2><p>The <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>PDP</a></strong> in a statement on Sunday lamented that terrorists, bandits, and other criminals have taken over every part of the country and the government and security agencies appear helpless.</p><p>It will be recalled that troops of the Nigerian military on Saturday <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>clashed with bandit terrorists</a></strong> forcing the closure of the Kaduna International Airport.</p><p>Gunmen invaded the airport, disrupting the operation of the airport services.</p><p>The incident had caused the death of a staff member whom the Kaduna State government revealed to have been shot by the assailants.</p><p>Reacting to the development, the PDP in a statement on Sunday signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Debo Olgunagba</strong></a> said it is alarming that the terrorists now target airports after taking over the roads.</p><p>The PDP added that the Kaduna airport attack is a clear indication that nowhere is safe again in Nigeria.</p><p>It accused <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>President Buhari</a></strong> of having a nonchalant attitude towards the security situation in the country, adding that he is clearly unable to tackle the challenges.</p><p>According to the PDP, the “invasion of the Kaduna International Airport by terrorists (code-named bandits by the APC) is a clear confirmation that our nation’s security, command and control structure under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) administration has completely collapsed.</p><p>“The alarming invasion of the airport by terrorists at a time outlaws, kidnappers and marauders have taken over our highways and railways has further heightened security concerns that nowhere is safe in the country under the APC.</p><p>“The refusal and failure of President Buhari and the APC to take action on the airport attack but continued to jamboree in Abuja in the name of a National Convention reveal and confirm that the Buhari administration has conceded sovereignty over parts of our country to terrorists.</p><p>“President Buhari’s nonchalant disposition to this grave security challenge indicates that his administration is unable, unwilling and or complicit in this particular attack as well as various other acts of terrorism in our country.</p><p>“It is indefensibly suspicious that while an international airport in our country was under attack by over 200 terrorists with many Nigerians being held hostage and traumatized, President Buhari and the APC continued in their carnival in Abuja without acknowledging or expressing concern. Is this not a case of “Buhari fiddles while Nigeria burns?”</p><p>The PDP added that clearly, the APC has failed and has become insensitive to the cries of the citizens.</p><p>It added that the terrorists and criminals are getting more emboldened as each day goes by because they realize Nigeria has a weak leader who is incapable and unwilling to take action.</p><p>“The APC government has failed, become numb to violence against our citizens and can no longer perform its primary duty under Section 14 (2)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) which provides that “security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government”.</p><p>“President Buhari’s failure to address the Kaduna Airport attack is consistent with his characteristic abdication of duty at critical times. Nigerians can recall how in January this year, Mr. President cancelled his scheduled visit to Zamfara State, a state that is daily traumatized by terrorists.</p><p>By that action, Mr. President allowed shared sovereignty with terrorists over a part of the territory of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. This acquiesces emboldened the terrorists to now expand their control to the international airport in Kaduna ostensibly with the possibility of using it to import arms and ammunition as well as coordinate terrorist activities in our country.</p><p>One of the main features or determinants of sovereignty is the ability of an authority to impose taxes, enforce collection, control commercial activities as well as exit and entry points including airports.</p><p>Under President Buhari terrorists have established sovereignty in substantial parts of the country, especially in the North West and North East regions, where terrorists execute laws and impose penalties, collect taxes, control commercial and transportation activities, and now scaringly take control of an international airport with grave negative consequences to our national image in the world.</p><p>Our country has never had it this bad with such a weak, uncoordinated and clueless President with an inhumane, visionless, and propaganda-driven political party like the APC.</p><p>Nigerians should therefore rally round the PDP in our mission to rescue our nation from the precipice and restore the unity and security of her people” the PDP added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FwZqmcoGKvra3MnqpmmqWdrrO1jJ%2Bmq2WblrG2usBmmKKqoKS%2FtXnArauam5tir7p5056pq6einsC1v4ysmLKrXaO8uLTEq5xmoaNiwKKyxGaYoJmZo3qquoynoKCdop6ucA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./395593-shule-ya-upili-ya-lugulu-yafungwa-baada-ya-wanafunzi-kulalamikia-kisa-cha-ubakaji-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Shule ya upili ya Lugulu yafungwa baada ya wanafunzi kulalamikia kisa cha ubakaji</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-tammy-still-with-phillip.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is TLC Star Tammy Slaton Still With Her Boyfriend, Phillip Redmond?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
