listen to those who are more knowledgeable than him in terms of management of the country’s economy instead of seeing them as threats.”</i></p><p>The governor, who said reactions of the President and his men to divergent opinions had become predictable, added that; <i>“this style of sending the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC), Department of State Services (DSS) and other agencies of the federal government against anyone that offers suggestions on how to rescue the country from total collapse is not in the best interest of Nigeria and its suffering masses.”</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Buhari under MASSIVE fire as Nigeria’s full economic recession is confirmed</p><p>According to a statement issued in Ado-Ekiti&nbsp;on Wednesday&nbsp;by his special assistant on public communications and new nedia, Lere Olayinka, the governor said President Buhari should realise that <i>“a nation of hungry people is a nation of angry people” and seek help from economic experts in the country, not minding their political, religious and ethnic affiliations.”</i></p><p>Governor Fayose, who particularly singled out the two former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) governors; Emir of Kano, Alhaji Sanusi Lamido Sanusi and Prof. Charles Soludo, who spoke at different fora last week, said; <i>“Instead of adopting the usual style of trying to silence them with EFCC or ICPC, the President should listen to them and take their advice on board because they are expert in economic matters.”</i></p><p><i>He said; “It is no longer about politics. Rather, it is about preventing hunger from exterminating Nigerians and I am sure that the president himself knows that hunger does not understand political parties.</i></p><p><i>“A bag of rice that was less than N8,000 when President Buhari assumed office is now over N20,000! How can a civil servant that is earning N18, 000 minimum wage survive when his monthly salary cannot buy one</i></p><p><i>bag of rice?</i></p><p><i>“Even basic drugs and medicare are getting out the reach of the common people and the resultant effect of this will be avoidable deaths!</i></p><p><i>“As at today, a bag of cement is N2, 200, increment of N600 on one bag in just one day.&nbsp;Within four months, exchange rate rose with more than 150 percent, with dollar that was a little above N200 then, now more than N400.</i></p><p><i>“The harsh reality is that a Nigerian whose income was N100,000 per month in 2015 and still earning the same N100,000 now is actually earning less than N40,000 because what he could buy with N100,000 then </i><i>cannot be bought with N200,000 now.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Fayose reacts after signing anti-herdsmen bill into law</p><p><i>"This is the worst time for parents whose children and wards will be going back to school in September. How to pay school fees is causing depression for a lot of parents in just over a year of the Buhari's administration.</i></p><p><i>“All these are signs that President Buhari needs help from those who can assist the country to avert this imminent economic collapse and he should not be ashamed to consult even those who ran the economy under </i><i>the PDP government of Dr Goodluck Jonathan because it appears that things were better then than now.</i></p><p><i>“Therefore, rather than preoccupying himself with newspaper cartoons, our President should listen to suggestions being offered by Nigerians on ways to bring the country’s economy out of recession that it is now.”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhnZ8lGloZpqlna6ztYyhnJquqWKzqr7EZp2asZ%2Bosm6xwqilqKWpY7W1ucs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./322437-wabunge-wazua-kioja-baada-ya-kushindwa-kuzungumza-kiswahili-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Wabunge wazua kioja baada ya kushindwa kuzungumza kiswahili</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./403026-magazeti-ya-jumanne-februari-16-makasiriko-ya-uhuru-ruto-yadhihirika-mazishini-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Magazeti ya Jumanne, Februari 16: &amp;quot;Makasiriko&amp;quot; ya Uhuru, Ruto yadhihirika mazishini</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
