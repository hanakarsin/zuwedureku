The latest documentary to join this list is <a href=#>Gunther’s Millions</a>, the newest kooky <a href=#>Netflix</a> documentary about a wealthy dog and his 13 Commandments.</p><p>The story goes that a wealthy countess left behind her $400 million inheritance to her dog, Gunther, and his descendants. Gunther made global news when he bought (and later sold) one of Madonna’s mansions. But within this story of riches, there’s deceit and a near-cult of people called the Burgundians who were forced to follow Gunther’s 13 Commandments. But what were these commandments?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Gunther’s “caretaker,” Maurizio Mian, claimed that Gunther and his "Burgundians" must live under a set of 13 Commandments from the countess’s estate documents.</h2><p>Although the story is that Maurizio Mian was just Gunther’s caretaker, who was also responsible for properly spending Gunther’s money, there’s much more to who Maurizio truly is. In trying to give Gunther the best life possible, or so he said, he created a lifestyle of wealth surrounded by young attractive people who lived in the house with Gunther.</p><p>All of this was part of Maurizio’s search for happiness. He brought in doctors, scientists, and more to figure out if there really was a way to be happy forever. In doing so, he also drafted up the 13 Commandments that the group was forced to live under. But don’t worry — they aren't too strict, as far as commandments go. Here are Gunther’s 13 Commandments:</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">1. Traditionalism: (You will) never be traditionalist (conservative)</h2><p>Apparently, Gunther the Dog isn't a fan of conservatives. Let’s get creative!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">2. Science and Research: (You will) always make science, it will heighten your pleasure.</h2><p>How do we make science if we aren't scientists? With pleasure at its center, we can get behind this commandment.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">3. Festivals, Amusement, and Work: Life is an endless festival</h2><p>This is a commandment! Life is a festival and we must always be celebrating it!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">4. Family and Marriage: Abolish the family</h2><p>OK, we don’t love this one. Especially if we’re wondering if Gunther’s "Burgundians" were part of a cult, one thing many cults do is isolate their followers from their families.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">5. Drugs, the Right to Joy, the Right to Hurt Oneself: Never bar the right to joy</h2><p>We agree that the right to joy should be inherent — even Thomas Jefferson agrees with the “pursuit of happiness.” But is the right to hurt oneself synonymous with the right to joy? Things are getting a bit dicey here.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">6. Sex: (You will) make love with science, whenever you want, and with whoever you like</h2><p>A commandment about someone else’s choices in regards to sex doesn’t sit quite right. Plus, the last clause of “with whoever you like” doesn’t clarify that there should be consent.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">7. Music: (You will) play music, it will help you to make science</h2><p>Everything seems to be in the name of science. Where does Gunther play into all of this? Is Gunther a scientist and a musician?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">8. Sport: (You will) make sport, it will help you make love</h2><p>Clearly, there are some sexual undertones to these commandments that are encouraging sexual relations between the Burgundians. How strictly these were enforced remains to be seen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">9. Country and Boundaries: Abolish all boundaries and all nations</h2><p>If this is a commandment, we don’t think anyone followed it… the world is still very much divided. If this just referred to those in the house, if we’ve learned anything from therapy, it’s that boundaries are a good thing.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">10. Arms and Technology: Don’t make war, make intelligent love</h2><p>We have a lot of questions. Does making love mean there is no war? And how do we differentiate between intelligent love and not intelligent love? These commandments seem difficult to follow.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">11. Study with Culture: The more you study, the better you are</h2><p>As academics and fans of culture, we can agree that studying and understanding culture does help us become more well-rounded.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">12. Wealth: (You will) be rich, for the sole sake of enjoying</h2><p>If it was that easy, we would be.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">13. Beauty and Intelligence: The clever make love better</h2><p>Again with the love-making… If anyone denies that Gunther’s pals were encouraged to make love, that denial would clearly be incorrect based on these commandments.</p><p>When it comes down to it, these are some unexpected commandments. And they’re very different from the Ten Commandments many of us are familiar with. But Gunther’s 13 Commandments make it clear that his life, and the life of those around him, was anything but ordinary.</p><p>Gunther's Millions is available to stream on Netflix on Feb. 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIywnKudXam1pnmQbGScp52irq%2BwzJ6lratdnMKvwMeeqaxlnZ65rbXOp6o%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./45742-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>BBA: Im Sorry For Embarrassing Nigerians Beverly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nigerians-react-to-buharis-facial-expression-as-presidential-aspirants-step-down-for-tinubu.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nigerians React To Buhari's Facial Expression As Presidential Aspirants Step Down For Tinubu</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
