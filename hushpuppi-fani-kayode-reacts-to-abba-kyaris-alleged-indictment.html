Not me!”</p><p>“Abba is one of the bravest, brightest and best cops in Nigeria and I will not believe these crazy allegations levelled against him or condemn him unless I see any evidence to the contrary.”</p><p>“He has proved himself over and over again when it comes to catching criminals and I do not believe that he is one himself. If he were he would not have such an excellent record in combating crime.”</p><p>“Nigerians seem to take delight in believing and assuming the worse about their best. That is part of our problem: we love and celebrate the evil but we despise, hate and seek to pull down the righteous and good. As far as I am concerned there are as many crooked, bent & killer cops all over the world as there are good ones & America has its fair share of both.The only people that ought to take pleasure in reading this crap about Abba are the kidnappers and terrorists in our country.”</p><p>“Allegations are a dime a dozen and an indictment does not amount to a conviction: show me the evidence or keep your mouth shut forever. I urge Abba to continue the good work he has been doing and not allow himself to be distracted by his numerous detractors.”</p><p>“This is a deep conspiracy to destroy his career and it will not work.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH14e5JpZqGto529trzPomSfmZ6eeqyt2KibnmWimq6kwNJmq6hlkZevonnKspiroaNirq24xKCcnWWZo7Gqr9OmnKesXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./good-news-for-nigerians-as-house-of-reps-seek-to-act-on-hike-of-food-prices.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Good News For Nigerians As House Of Reps Seek To Act On Hike Of Food Prices</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-killed-sonya-ivanoff.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Killed Sonya Ivanoff?
