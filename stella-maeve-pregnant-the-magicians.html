Still reeling from the death of her best friend, she has to focus on saving the world. No big deal.&nbsp;</p><p>Julia has never been more integral to the show, and the actress who plays her is going through a big change as well.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Stella Maeve pregnant from The Magicians?</a> The actress shared exciting news about her personal life.

She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> three photos of her in her bra and underwear with a "12 weeks" sticker on her stomach to announce the news.</p><p>"That's right," she captioned the photo. "You can have it all."</p><p>The pregnancy news came just a few months after Stella told her fans about her engagement to Benjamin Wadsworth. The two revealed that Benjamin proposed on May 10, and Stella showed off her engagement ring online.</p><p>The couple is a match made in SyFy heaven. Benjamin starred on the 1980s counterculture SyFy series Deadly Class before it got canceled in 2019. The two met because of their respective shows. Stella and Benjamin were both at San Diego Comic Con in 2018 to speak at panels for their shows.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My beautiful little wife ♥️</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>WadsworthBenjamin</a> (@benjamin_wadsworth) on Aug 20, 2019 at 4:25pm PDT</p></figure><p>"I was waiting to go on to do the [Deadly Class] panel and my manager was talking to her and said, 'Ben, come over here and meet Stella' and then it was up from there.
