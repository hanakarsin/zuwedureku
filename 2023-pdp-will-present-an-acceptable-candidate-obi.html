They might be talking of consensus for the whole of Nigeria. So we are going around and interacting with people and discussing everything.</p><p>“You never can tell, I might be the consensus candidate they are advocating for. We have been talking with each other and I believe that in the end, we will find out who is the best person for the job.</p><p>“I have strong support from all over Nigeria and in this recruitment, we must be able to interrogate people’s past and what they have been able to do in their previous jobs to guide Nigerians in making the selection”.</p><p>He further stated that he would formally declare for the presidency in the coming days.</p><p>According to the former Governor, his manifesto would also be released soon, adding that if elected the first thing he would do is to bring back the trust in governance.</p><p>He added: “I can turn this country around. At the moment, this country is at its lowest ebb. Crime will be reduced when people are gainfully employed and I have a plan of how to bring people out of poverty as quickly as possible and the first line of tackling poverty is reviving the economy”.</p><p>Obi appreciated the professionals for sincerely believing in him, assuring them of his commitment to a better Nigeria.</p><p>He said, “I am also committed to the future of our youths. We must get to work and once we do that, we build a better Nigeria.”</p><p>The leader of the group, Daniel Wilbert while presenting the form said he and his friends and colleagues across the country contributed and purchased the expression of interest and nomination forms for Peter Obi because they saw in him the qualities of a good president.</p><p>“The working class professionals from different parts of the country believe that Obi is best suited for the job at this turbulent period in the country’s history. We looked around and we have seen that you are the best for the job, hence our decision to identify with your aspiration.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH11e49rZmtoYmh6sbDPZq6ipJxivbOx0p6lrWWRo3qir8Kep62ZkqGybq%2FAp5uinJGpsm67waJm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./antoinette-bower-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Antoinette Bower - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-voight-leaving-chicago-pd.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Chicago P.D.'
