Through his writing, particularly in Diana: The Voice of Change, he has shared insight into who the late princess really was beyond her public image, and thus humanized her even further for the masses.</p><p>In doing such, Stewart — who was the princess' former voice and presence coach — has touched on one of the most commonly asked questions nowadays regarding the royal family: Would <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, if she were still alive today, have gotten along with and even sympathized with Meghan Markle?</p><p>Stewart exclusively explained to Distractify exactly what their similarities are, as well as his thoughts on what a friendship between the two may have been like.

I mean, they would have gotten on like a house on fire!" remarked the author when asked about any similarities he sees between the two.</p><p>Stewart then went on to note Meghan's best qualities, explaining, "I feel that Meghan is a voice of change. This smart, intelligent, beautiful, forthright individual who is so articulate. I’m mesmerized by what [she and Harry are] both doing, I think it’s absolutely extraordinary."</p><p>Stewart also gave the former actress one of the greatest compliments he could in relation to Diana, calling them both "agents of change."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Duke and Duchess of Sussex (@sussexroyal)</a></p></figure><p>"The point is that they’re both agents of change, you see?" he added. "So many famous people have commented on agents of change. Gandhi said, ‘First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, and then you win.’ It’s fascinating that a man that lived all those decades ago was able to comment on this current situation almost as if he were actually here."</p><p>An "agent of change" is widely defined as someone who recognizes a poignant issue and decides to take action against it.</p><p>Clearly, Stewart is confident that Meghan and Diana would have been some of the closest members of the royal family, and his comments on how Diana was as a whole solidify that even further. "I meet many people," he admitted, "I work with extraordinary people, and most of them impinge on my life in some way. But Diana affected the whole of my being in an extraordinary fashion because her love was just so extraordinary."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpb%2BqusKeqqxllJ6ur62MmqWdZZ2atKmtzWakmqqbobJuv8imoKWZop7BqrHS</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./robert-sepulveda-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Robert Seplveda - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./miguel-zarate-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Miguel Zarate - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
