(SPOILERS)</h2><p>Though many fans want to know if Clayton gets engaged (and who he gives his final rose to) before the finale airs on TV, there are no definitive spoilers at this time regarding the ending of Season 26.</p><p>It is unclear at this time who Clayton picks — though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Steve</a> has shared that Rachel Recchia, Gabby Windey, and Susie Evans are allegedly the three women who make it to the overnight dates — and whether or not he proposes.</p><p>However, ahead of the Season 26, premiere, Clayton appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a>, and he shared that he was able to "find love."</p><p>"I did find love, and I was a little skeptical going into the whole journey, but I'm so pleasantly surprised that things worked out much different than what I had thought [sic]," he said on the morning series. "I'm just so excited to watch it back and have everyone else watch it as well."</p><p>Though Clayton was tight-lipped about a potential engagement, based on his comments, he is likely (at the very least) in a committed relationship with one of his contestants.</p><p>As Clayton gets ready to bring his romance out in the open, Bachelor Nation star Jared Haibon has some words of wisdom for the Missouri native and whoever his mystery love turns out to be.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Jared Haibon on his advice for Clayton Echard to navigate a potential post-'Bachelor' engagement.</h2><p>Though Jared has never been the lead himself, he does know a thing or two about having a high profile relationship in the public eye. Jared originally rose to fame as a fan favorite contestant on Kaitlyn Bristowe's season of The Bachelorette, and he later became known for his complicated relationship with his now-wife Ashley Iaconetti Haibon during his two-season stint on Bachelor in Paradise.</p><p>Ashley and Jared didn't exactly leave the beach in Season 3 on the best of terms romantically, but they later returned to the place where they fell in love, and they got engaged in front of the cameras in 2018.</p><p>Since Jared has navigated a successful off-show relationship with a co-star, he does have some advice for Clayton in order to avoid a Bachelor break-up: don't let outsiders affect what's going on in the relationship.</p><p>"My advice would be to ignore the noise ... There's just going to be so much out there. We've heard of so many couples, our friends, and the stress gets to them, and it affects their relationship, and they end up breaking up," Jared said to Distractify while promoting a partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways.</p><p>As longtime fans of the franchise know, many couples struggle to adapt to having a normal relationship once the cameras stop rolling.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Courtesy of Jared Haibon</span></figure><p>He also noted that it's important for any reality TV couples to prepare to adjust once that "noise" quiets down.</p><p>"A lot of people leave this show on such a high, and at some point, the high is going to slow down. When it does, then you're just in a relationship with this person, and it's very normal. You have to be ready for that, because it's different than the relationship you're in right now," he added. "Just be mindful those things."</p><p>Will Clayton and his Bachelor love join the ranks of successful couples from the franchise, like Jared and Ashley? Time will tell!</p><p>The Bachelor airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC. Users can also catch up on the series on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLmixdOopWadk52us7CMm5icoJWhvLN5xKeemp%2BVorKvwA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./northern-youths-awards-zubby-micheal-hours-after-throwing-bundles-of-naira-note-at-obi-cubanas-mum-burial.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Northern Youths Awards Zubby Micheal Hours After Throwing Bundles Of Naira Note At Obi Cubana's Mum</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./303960-deputy-president-william-ruto-visits-jonathan-toroitichs-family-baringo-home-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Deputy President William Ruto visits late Jonathan Toroitichs family in Baringo</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
