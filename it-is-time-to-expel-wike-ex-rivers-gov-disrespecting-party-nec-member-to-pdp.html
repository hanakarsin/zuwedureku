Every manager has his own style but if I was the chairman, I don’t see any reason Wike should still be in this party. I don’t understand why he is still laying claim to the membership of the PDP after his open flirtation and connivance with the ruling party. His shameless association with the Presidency and the APC has come full cycle.</p><p>“It is not a matter of if or when, it is a matter of integrity. Wike cannot be dining and wining with the APC and still claim to be a member of the PDP. He should know this!”</p><p>Osadolor noted that whatever Wike gets from the APC would be a reward for betraying the party that brought him to the national limelight.</p><p>He added, “APC is dealing with Wike as an individual. If the ruling party wants to reward him for his betrayal of the PDP, it is up to them. PDP will survive without Wike and the poison chalice he is being given by the APC to eat.</p><p>“We all know that anything given to Wike now will be a reward for the saboteur role he played against his own party. Truth is, the whole world knows that until his association with this party (PDP), not much was known about him.”</p><p>According to him, the PDP leadership must not compromise&nbsp;discipline while trying to revamp the PDP in preparation for future tasks.</p><p>He stated, “A former president produced by this party left at a time; a vice president defected. Many governors and senators, to mention a few, left at one time or the other but the PDP remains. Nobody, no matter how highly placed, is bigger than the party on which platform he or she was elected.</p><p>“This is what Wike should know. His exit, suspension or whatever will not affect the PDP in any way. Our leaders should know this and realise that as members of the party, we must protect it at all times.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BuZqKsXZ7AbsDIppxmrJ9isrm8xKVksKGbmnqmxIyroK%2Bdoqh6qLvVZpuiq6KawLGxwq2gp59dpa6zwNhmpZ6bXaKyrq7Eq2Stp12lsbF7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-sinner-season-3-filming-locations.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Season 3 of 'The Sinner' Shares at Least One Shooting Location With 'Gossip Girl'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./amy-carter-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Amy Carter Lived in the White House as a Child Where Is the Former First Daughter Now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
