have beefed up security around the National Assembly over the planned protest of legislative aides.</h2><p>It was gathered that security personnel including anti-riot and regular policemen, Department of State Services (DSS) personnel and Sergeant-at-Arms have surrounded the complex.</p><p>Doors leading to the foyer at the White House from the Senate and House of Representatives chambers have not only been shut but being guarded by security operatives.</p><p>This is due to the planned protest of Legislative aides, under the auspices of Salary Arrears Affected Legislative Aides (SAALA).</p><p>They had vowed to ground activities at the National Assembly beginning from today over alleged non-payment of their 2019 salary arrears and allowances in the sum of N3.1 billion.</p><p>But the Chairman of the National Assembly Legislative Aides Forum (NASSLAF), Salisu Zuru, had described their planned protest as illegal, the Nation reports.</p><p>The SAALA had in a statement signed by its coordinator, Zebis Prince and five other members, said the protest had become necessary to press home their demands.</p><p>The SAALA maintained that they were being owed N3.1 billion, comprising N1.35 billion in salary arrears and N1.75 billion for consequential adjustment on minimum wage.</p><p>“We will picket the National Assembly Complex, as well as the venue of a training organised by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS) billed for Monday, Sept. 27, to press home our demand for better working conditions,” they said.</p><p>According to them, while over 1,300 aides were still being owed salary arrears, none of the 2,345 legislative aides has received the consequential adjustment on minimum wage, since their appointments in June 2019.</p><p>They alleged that the Clerk to the National Assembly, Ojo Olatunde Amos, had disobeyed a resolution passed by the House of Representatives mandating him to pay the arrears.</p><p>“It is clear that Legislative Aides have exhausted their patience and in the coming weeks, starting from Monday, Sept. 27, Legislative Aides will embark on series of actions to drive home their demands.</p><p>“For starters, we shall ensure that the selective training planned for Monday by NILDS does not hold by mobilising our members to picket the venue.</p><p>“From Tuesday, we shall also picket the National Assembly complex to draw the world’s attention to the embarrassment going on in the nation’s premier law-making institution,” the statement reads in part.</p><p>Reacting, Chairman of NASSLAF, Salisu Zuru, said the group is out to perpetuate illegality.</p><p>The statement reads in part: “Information reaching me has it that some disgruntled Aides are planning to disturb the peace of NASS.</p><p>“I seriously and urgently wish to bring to your attention the likely breach of peace in National Assembly starting from tomorrow being 27th September, 2021 by some disenchanted and egocentric Aides whose stock in trade is always confusion. Their grouse is that some of them have not been paid their Salary Arrears.</p><p>“Be verily informed that apart from the Protests they want to stage tomorrow, they have concluded plans to Disrupt the Training being organized by NILDS and which will start on Tuesday after tomorrow.</p><p>“These Aides are embarking on illegality because none of them is an executive member or Members of CWC of NASSLAF, the body constitutionally empowered to run the affairs of Aides.</p><p>“The peace of NASS should not be allowed to be disrupted in the guise of salary arrears.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FwZpuqlZa4qrrGZqqem6WntrXFjJucnp6VmXq2vIyaq2amkam2sLrApWSaq6OauqO42GaYrGWcmrSqv8uaq6KulWKuqrDErGSpqp%2BpsrTAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./transfer-update-on-greenwood-phillips-benrahma-robertson-varane-others.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Transfer Update On Greenwood, Phillips, Benrahma, Robertson, Varane, Others</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./august22-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>August 22 Birthdays | Famous Birthdays</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
