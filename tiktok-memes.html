Then, Vine went away and everyone pretty much started using Snapchat and Instagram's video feature.</p><p>But then people got tired of that for whatever reason, and a new widespread social phenomenon began, <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Sure, there are several memes about how lame TikTok is and how it stinks and how annoying a lot of folks on the platform are, but the same can be said of throngs of Twitter users who stan terrible music acts, or Instagram "influencers" who attack pseudo-philosophical ramblings with pictures of their asses and abs.</p><p>That being said, while TikTok's annoying-as-all-hell advertising campaigns and branding are enough to make you want to sit on your porch and scream "GET OFF MY LAWN!" to anyone who appears to be under the age of 22, there are some legit gems on the platform that you can't miss. Here are some absolute winners I've come across.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Best. Lapdance.
