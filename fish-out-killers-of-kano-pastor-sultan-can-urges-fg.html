Prof. <strong>Cornelius Omonokhua,</strong> read: “The Council received the sad news from the Kano State Branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, on Wednesday, September 22, 2021, that Pastor Shuaibu Yohanna was murdered by some irate youths of Masu community where he had lived and pastored the New Life for All Nations Church for about 10 years.”</p><p>Commending the leadership of the Kano State branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, and the assistant coordinator, CAN, Sumaila LGA for being proactive in visiting Masu to manage and checkmating further conflicts and reprisal, NIREC called on the citizens of Kano and Nigeria to continue to strive for peaceful coexistence in the various communities of the nation.</p><p>It said: “We also appreciate the role of the security agents in ensuring peace by protecting lives and property in the community. Those who did not take the law into their own hands by contacting the DPO of Gani Police Division are well appreciated. NIREC condemns the killing of the pastor, the attack on the church building, school, staff office and the destruction of his house. No reason can justify this criminality.</p><p>“We, therefore, condole with the family of Pastor Shuaibu Yohanna and pray that God grant him eternal repose. We also pray that those arrested and all those involved in this criminal act must be seen to be dealt with in accordance with the law of the land.</p><p>NIREC appeals to the Kano State command of the Nigeria Police Force to honestly do the needful. We also call on all the relevant security agencies to properly investigate this gruesome murder and ensure that those found culpable are made to face justice.</p><p>“We call for calm as NIREC is already in touch with Rev. Adeolu Samuel Adeyemo, CAN Chairman, Kano State; and the Emir of Kano, His Highness, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero, to find the way forward out of this unfortunate incident.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe49xZp%2Bho516sMHTZqKipJyav7R5zp9kpJmepHqxrdKtpqtlo6q5ta3NZpqapl2qv6ix0madoGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ice-t-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ice T - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./david-wolfe-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>David Wolfe - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
