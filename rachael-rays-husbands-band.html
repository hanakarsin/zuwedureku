Between $40 a Day, 30 Minute Meals, and The Rachael Ray Show, she's one of the most prominent faces on Food Network and beyond. But when the 51-year-old isn't cooking up some delicious meals for her dedicated viewers on TV, she's likely spending time with her husband, who unlike her, isn't a chef himself. Here's everything we know about Rachael's husband, John M. Cusimano!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Rachael Ray's husband?</h2><p>Rachael Ray's husband is John M. Cusimano. The couple has been married for 14 years (and together for 20) after tying the knot in September 2005 in Tuscany. John is a successful actor and movie producer, with some of his acting credits including Crashing and World War Mud.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>He also produced Rurouni Kenshin: Wandering Samurai, and has appeared as himself on E! True Hollywood Story, Entertainment Tonight, Rachael's Vacation, Cake Boss, and The Rachael Ray Show (you likely recognize him from making guest appearances on his wife's talk show!).</p><p>He additionally co-authored My Year in Meals and My Year in Cocktails with Rachael back in 2012.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Rachael Ray's husband in a band?</h2><p>Yes, John is in a band. In addition to his many other talents and hobbies, John's most notable gig is his involvement in the rock band called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cringe</a>. He's the lead singer of the group, and also plays guitar and writes music for them. John, bassist Johnny Blaze, lead guitarist James Rotondi, and drummer Shawn Pelton have played on The Rachael Ray Show, been on tour around the U.S., and also released a few albums to date, including their newest, Everywhere You've Been.</p><p>Despite their different interests, Rachael and John seem to have a very genuine and sweet relationship filled with much love. For their anniversary in September, the chef wrote a touching tribute for her husband on Instagram. "John and I make sense. We donâ€™t care when we eat, we care that we eat together. And weâ€™ve been together, this John and this Rachael, every day since the day we met. And thatâ€™s something. Itâ€™s a lot. And some days, itâ€™s everything. I love you, @johnmcusimano," she wrote at the time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>John and I make sense.

While talking to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2007, she revealed the reason why she never had kids. "I work too much to be an appropriate parent," she admitted. "I just feel like I would do a bad job if I actually took the time to literally give birth to a kid right now and try and juggle everything Iâ€™m doing."&nbsp;</p><p>Between their many talents and sweet love story, Rachael and John are quite a power couple!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66ktMCeo2aqka7AbrTUrJmappSoeqOtzZ0%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./iphone-secret-button.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>TikTokers iPhone Secret Button Post Goes Viral</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./241638-mkewe-diamond-na-ndugu-za-mmewe-wa-zamani-wazozana-punde-tu-baada-ya-kifo-ch-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Mkewe Diamond na ndugu za mmewe wa zamani WAZOZANA punde tu baada ya kifo chake</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
