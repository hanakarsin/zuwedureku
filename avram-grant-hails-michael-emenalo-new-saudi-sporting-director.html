He held that position until 2017.</p><p>During his reign, the Nigerian football administrator fully revamped the club’s academy through scouting. He also ensured the women’s squad gained prominence. Hence, he is credited for enabling both the success of the Chelsea Football Club Academy and the recent revival of the Chelsea Football Club Women’s Squad.</p><p>Emenalo, who left his position at Chelsea six years ago, was appointed as the Saudi Pro League’s Sporting Director this week. A new wave of recruits is being introduced by the Middle Eastern nation following the recent signing of many players from Europe.</p><p>Grant who is the head coach of the Zambian national team and is currently in New Zealand getting ready for the 2023 Women’s World Cup described Michael Emenalo as “a very intelligent man”.</p><p>Journalist Osasu Obayiuwana quoted Grant as saying: “Mike has made the most of the opportunities he has got. And I’m not surprised, as he’s a very intelligent man.</p><p>“He was my player at Maccabi in the Israeli League for two years and I actually wanted him to be my assistant coach there before he had a personal tragedy.</p><p>“When I was later at Chelsea and I recommended that the club take him on as a scout, there was so much opposition to it. Some people wanted to kill me. Not because of his colour, as many people think, but because of his lack of experience.</p><p>“But Roman Abramovich asked me whether I truly believed in him and I said that I did. He then said that if I believed in him he would be brought to the club. And Mike did a fantastic job.</p><p>“You can give a man a chance but he has to make the most of his opportunities.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5FtZpquopa6brPRmqWtZZiWtq2%2FjKagnKCRmrluscyepZqkn2K7psOMrJiunJliwLG70a2gp59dmbazscKtpqtn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./craftedrl-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>CraftedRL - Age, Family, Bio</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ariana-grande-cheating-history.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ariana Grande Has Been Accused of Cheating Multiple Times Before Ethan Slater Drama</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
