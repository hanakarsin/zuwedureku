It is a choice between two paths: the path of unity and progress or the path of division and backwardness.”</p><p>“We need a new kind of leadership that will steer us to a positive path. In 2023, we want a President who has ideas on how to fix Nigeria. We want a president who understands, inspires, and is empathetic.</p><p>“I have contested for the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria a couple of times in the past. My enduring persistence is borne out of my passion to rekindle the Nigerian dream that I was privileged to live.</p><p>“Nigeria is a land of possibility. There is no challenging background that will make any Nigerian give up. I am a living witness to what is possible in Nigeria.</p><p>“You and I know that Nigeria is in dire need of visionary leadership. Our fundamental principles and purpose as a nation have never been challenged as it is today. Presently, Nigeria is a sinking ship; it must be rescued urgently. That is why I am happy to announce my candidacy for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, under the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).</p><p>“I offer myself to rescue the sinking ship. Under my captainship, this ship will sail to a brighter course by the grace of God. However, this journey is not mine alone. It is a journey I am taking for all Nigerians. It is also a journey to a destination I planned with my late great mentor, Major General Shehu Musa Yar’adua, and with my beloved compatriot, the late, and great, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola. May their souls rest in peace.”</p><p>Also, in a series of tweets from his Twitter handle, Atiku who has tried unsuccessfully in 1993, 2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019, said on Wednesday that he believes the 2023 outing would be different.</p><p>He added that he has never been as confident as he is feeling about the 2023 outing.</p><p>“I have never been this optimistic, and with your support and God’s grace, we will get to the promised land,” he wrote on Twitter.</p><p>“This time around is different; our journey will not end at the poll; we will get to work and rescue Nigeria. I invite every Nigerian to join me in this mission to save our dear country.</p><p>“Nigeria is a land of possibility. There is no challenging background that will make any Nigerian give up. I am a living witness to what is possible in Nigeria.</p><p>“Though we all have different lives and goals and desires we all want one future.”</p><p>As earlier reported by <strong>Naija News</strong>, some of the dignitaries&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>present at the official declaration</a></strong> were Adamawa State Governor, Umaru Fintiri, former Kogi Senator, Dino Melaye, former Vice President Muhammad Namadi Sambo, and former Niger State Governor, Babangida Aliyu.</p><p>Others who stormed the venue are Chief Tom Ikimi, Ambassador Roland Omowa, and Josephine Anenih.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH10e5FsZq2gmah6tbXMnmSaqp%2Bqu6V5yKxknaGWm7Kzsc2tZKyZqah6osDIpKxmmaNitaZ5zp%2BdopuZlrmtxYydnJykkaeytHnFqKlmamBngG680Z6qopyVo7C6ew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./elon-musk-cybertruck-memes.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Elon Musk Revealed Tesla's Cybertruck and It's Already a Meme</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./popular-actor-aminu-bono-is-dead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Popular Actor, Aminu Bono Is Dead</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
