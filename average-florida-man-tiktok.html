However, he also uses his platform to highlight important issues in his state.</p><p>Most of his videos consist of workout progress TikToks, inspo posts, and some meme fodder here and there. But AverageFloridaMan also isn't afraid to talk about his <a href=#>mental health</a> and the leaps and bounds he's had to take as a veteran in his home state in order to both receive the care he seeks as well as raise awareness for its importance among his community.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@AverageFloridaMan</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">AverageFloridaMan raises awareness for mental health in an emotional video.</h2><p>In May 2023, AverageFloridaMan posted an incredibly emotional TikTok in which he divulges his difficult experience with receiving mental health care as a veteran.</p><p>"Seven times over the last f--king six years, dude," he tearfully discusses in his two-minute video. "The VA [Veterans Affairs] has continued to let me down. I just want some f--king continuity in care with mental health providers."</p><p>He goes on to explain that through this system, he hasn't been able to get in touch with therapists and has even had his case denied by a preferred specialist after weeks of waiting to hear back from them. He also dreaded the process of having to introduce himself to a completely new therapist and having to divulge his trauma all over again.</p><p>"I gotta open f--king Pandora's box again because they're gonna wanna know everything and then I'm gonna have to live through working through that for a f--king month."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@averagefloridaman href=#>@averagefloridaman</a><p>Reposting the original video.. i have posted and update, please be sure to watch that, i knew that by sharing my all to common story and allowing myself to be vulnerable in front of the world that i might light a fire of change.

One person wrote, "You are not alone. It's not right what they do to you and others like you. Big hugs."</p><p>Another person sympathized directly, stating "I know how you feel. I have been through all that [and] it is miserable. I am still dealing with this s--t. I know it is heartbreaking. I am here for you."</p><p>Others urged him and people like him to vote for politicians who will actively support policies for veteran support.</p><p>He would later post an update revealing that his voice has been heard and that he is taking an active part in advocating for more mental health care resources for veterans.</p><p>"I've been on the phone with multiple congressional staffers today [as well as] presidents of different divisions of different VA hospitals around the country," he revealed.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@averagefloridaman href=#>@averagefloridaman</a><p>Update to my situation, allowing my self to be vulnerable and share and extremely emotional situation and all to common problem inside veteran healthcare.

Luckily, he was able to schedule new sessions with the physician he had initially requested.</p><p>"I used my voice and my platform to create change for me and create a lot of awareness for issues that other vets [who are] struggling mentally are dealing with," he said.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know needs help, use </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator</strong></a><strong> to find support for mental health and substance use disorders in your area or call 1-800-662-4357 for 24-hour assistance.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsOmvsCgnGaenKS%2FqrDAZqSapl2ptqzAzqQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./chase-hudson-lilhuddy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Chase &amp;quot;LILHUDDY&amp;quot; Hudson Latest News and Updates</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./network-shutdown-in-zamfara-katsina-violates-human-rights-serap-to-buhari.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Network Shutdown In Zamfara, Katsina Violates Human Rights</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
