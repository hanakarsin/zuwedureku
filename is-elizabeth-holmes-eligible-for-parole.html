The prosecution asked for 15 years, while her defense team asked for a maximum sentence of 18 months, preferably in home confinement.</p><p>As part of her sentence, Holmes must serve 85 percent of her allotted time before she can become eligible for parole. That means that she will serve well over 9 years, and is unlikely to be eligible for parole until sometime in the 2030s.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Elizabeth Holmes and her husband at a March 2023 restitution trial.</p></figure><p>The exact timing of her release from prison won't be known for years, but it's clear that this sentence is meant to be served in prison, and is designed in part to be a severe punishment for her role in bilking both investors and the public through the product she was offering at Theranos.</p><p>Holmes sobbed during the sentencing hearing, saying that she accepted responsibility for everything that had happened around Theranos.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Holmes will serve out her sentence in Texas.</h2><p>Holmes reported to a minimum security federal prison in Bryan, Tex., northwest of Houston. Holmes grew up in the area and aspired from a young age to be a tech visionary along the lines of <a href=#>Steve Jobs.</a></p><p>Now, Holmes is <a href=#>leaving behind two kids,</a> both of which were conceived around the time of her trial and sentencing. FPC Bryan is a federal prison for women and currently houses about 700 inmates —&nbsp;including Real Housewives of Salt Lake City star <a href=#>Jen Shah.</a></p><p>Prison camps like FPC Bryan typically have fairly minimal staffing, and most of the inmates at the facility also work jobs. Those in the facility who are eligible work can earn between 12 cents and $1.15/hr for their work, which ranges from food services to factory employment that is done in collaboration with outside organizations.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBS</a>, Holmes is likely to have to share a cell with as many as three other inmates.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>Prisoners at the facility can watch TV or read books in their spare time, but they do have to be in their cells by an 8 p.m. curfew every night. There is also space for exercise and a running track on the 37-acre property.</p><p>Family can visit prisoners in the facility regularly, and there are also designated areas for children to play there.</p><p>Although Holmes isn't eligible for parole for 9 years, there are other ways her sentence could be shortened, including early release programs and rewards for good behavior. The sentence is for 11 years, but only time will tell how long she actually serves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuscuisZqalam1brTOpaSeq12auaqzyJujnmWWpL9uvMCrpqWd</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./obasanjo-was-right-fani-kayode-is-a-foodie-serial-hustler-dino-melaye-blasts-apc-chieftain.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Obasanjo Was Right, Fani-Kayode Is A Foodie, Serial Hustler</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./edo-2024-im-fully-independent-not-obasekis-third-term-project-ighodalo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Edo 2024: I'm Fully Independent, Not Obasekis Third Term Project</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./2023-tinubu-to-unveil-a-muslim-running-mate-next-month-ajomale.html>2023: Tinubu To Unveil A Muslim Running Mate Next Month</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./damian-musk-html.html>Damian Musk - Age, Family, Bio</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./just-in-voting-ends-at-pdp-presidential-primary-election.html>Voting Ends At PDP Presidential Primary Election</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./409421-water-supply-nairobi-cbd-disrupted-expressway-contractor-destroys-pipes-html.html>Water Supply in Nairobi CBD Disrupted after Expressway Contractor Destroys Pipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./415784-uchaguzi-mkuu-2022-makundi-katika-vuta-nkuvute-ya-kutafuta-mbabe-jamii-ya-mulembe-html.html>Kinyang'anyiro 2022: Kapu la Kura za Mulembe Laamsha Tamaa za Wanasiasa Wanaojipanga kwa Vikundi</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/post/>Post</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 BeamVibe.
