Here were Victoria's remarks about their union.</p>When we got married, we weren’t pastors. We were just two young people.

It’s time to turn those ashes loose. If you went through a divorce, let it go. God has somebody better in your future.<p class=align-left>The statement led to the speculations that Joel was either unhappy or the duo had already split.
